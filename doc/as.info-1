`@FILE'
     Read command-line options from FILE.  The options read are
     inserted in place of the original @FILE option.  If FILE does not
     exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
     literally, and not removed.

     Options in FILE are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
     character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
     option in either single or double quotes.  Any character
     (including a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character
     to be included with a backslash.  The FILE may itself contain
     additional @FILE options; any such options will be processed
     recursively.

`-a[cdghlmns]'
     Turn on listings, in any of a variety of ways:

    `-ac'
          omit false conditionals

    `-ad'
          omit debugging directives

    `-ag'
          include general information, like as version and options
          passed

    `-ah'
          include high-level source

    `-al'
          include assembly

    `-am'
          include macro expansions

    `-an'
          omit forms processing

    `-as'
          include symbols

    `=file'
          set the name of the listing file

     You may combine these options; for example, use `-aln' for assembly
     listing without forms processing.  The `=file' option, if used,
     must be the last one.  By itself, `-a' defaults to `-ahls'.

`--alternate'
     Begin in alternate macro mode.  *Note `.altmacro': Altmacro.

`--compress-debug-sections'
     Compress DWARF debug sections using zlib with SHF_COMPRESSED from
     the ELF ABI.  The resulting object file may not be compatible with
     older linkers and object file utilities.  Note if compression
     would make a given section _larger_ then it is not compressed.

`--compress-debug-sections=none'
`--compress-debug-sections=zlib'
`--compress-debug-sections=zlib-gnu'
`--compress-debug-sections=zlib-gabi'
     These options control how DWARF debug sections are compressed.
     `--compress-debug-sections=none' is equivalent to
     `--nocompress-debug-sections'.  `--compress-debug-sections=zlib'
     and `--compress-debug-sections=zlib-gabi' are equivalent to
     `--compress-debug-sections'.  `--compress-debug-sections=zlib-gnu'
     compresses DWARF debug sections using zlib.  The debug sections
     are renamed to begin with `.zdebug'.  Note if compression would
     make a given section _larger_ then it is not compressed nor
     renamed.

`--nocompress-debug-sections'
     Do not compress DWARF debug sections.  This is usually the default
     for all targets except the x86/x86_64, but a configure time option
     can be used to override this.

`-D'
     Ignored.  This option is accepted for script compatibility with
     calls to other assemblers.

`--debug-prefix-map OLD=NEW'
     When assembling files in directory `OLD', record debugging
     information describing them as in `NEW' instead.

`--defsym SYM=VALUE'
     Define the symbol SYM to be VALUE before assembling the input file.
     VALUE must be an integer constant.  As in C, a leading `0x'
     indicates a hexadecimal value, and a leading `0' indicates an octal
     value.  The value of the symbol can be overridden inside a source
     file via the use of a `.set' pseudo-op.

`-f'
     "fast"--skip whitespace and comment preprocessing (assume source is
     compiler output).

`-g'
`--gen-debug'
     Generate debugging information for each assembler source line
     using whichever debug format is preferred by the target.  This
     currently means either STABS, ECOFF or DWARF2.

`--gstabs'
     Generate stabs debugging information for each assembler line.  This
     may help debugging assembler code, if the debugger can handle it.

`--gstabs+'
     Generate stabs debugging information for each assembler line, with
     GNU extensions that probably only gdb can handle, and that could
     make other debuggers crash or refuse to read your program.  This
     may help debugging assembler code.  Currently the only GNU
     extension is the location of the current working directory at
     assembling time.

`--gdwarf-2'
     Generate DWARF2 debugging information for each assembler line.
     This may help debugging assembler code, if the debugger can handle
     it.  Note--this option is only supported by some targets, not all
     of them.

`--gdwarf-sections'
     Instead of creating a .debug_line section, create a series of
     .debug_line.FOO sections where FOO is the name of the
     corresponding code section.  For example a code section called
     .TEXT.FUNC will have its dwarf line number information placed into
     a section called .DEBUG_LINE.TEXT.FUNC.  If the code section is
     just called .TEXT then debug line section will still be called
     just .DEBUG_LINE without any suffix.

`--size-check=error'
`--size-check=warning'
     Issue an error or warning for invalid ELF .size directive.

`--elf-stt-common=no'
`--elf-stt-common=yes'
     These options control whether the ELF assembler should generate
     common symbols with the `STT_COMMON' type.  The default can be
     controlled by a configure option `--enable-elf-stt-common'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

`--target-help'
     Print a summary of all target specific options and exit.

`-I DIR'
     Add directory DIR to the search list for `.include' directives.

`-J'
     Don't warn about signed overflow.

`-K'
     Issue warnings when difference tables altered for long
     displacements.

`-L'
`--keep-locals'
     Keep (in the symbol table) local symbols.  These symbols start with
     system-specific local label prefixes, typically `.L' for ELF
     systems or `L' for traditional a.out systems.  *Note Symbol
     Names::.

`--listing-lhs-width=NUMBER'
     Set the maximum width, in words, of the output data column for an
     assembler listing to NUMBER.

`--listing-lhs-width2=NUMBER'
     Set the maximum width, in words, of the output data column for
     continuation lines in an assembler listing to NUMBER.

`--listing-rhs-width=NUMBER'
     Set the maximum width of an input source line, as displayed in a
     listing, to NUMBER bytes.

`--listing-cont-lines=NUMBER'
     Set the maximum number of lines printed in a listing for a single
     line of input to NUMBER + 1.

`--no-pad-sections'
     Stop the assembler for padding the ends of output sections to the
     alignment of that section.  The default is to pad the sections,
     but this can waste space which might be needed on targets which
     have tight memory constraints.

`-o OBJFILE'
     Name the object-file output from `as' OBJFILE.

`-R'
     Fold the data section into the text section.

`--hash-size=NUMBER'
     Set the default size of GAS's hash tables to a prime number close
     to NUMBER.  Increasing this value can reduce the length of time it
     takes the assembler to perform its tasks, at the expense of
     increasing the assembler's memory requirements.  Similarly
     reducing this value can reduce the memory requirements at the
     expense of speed.

`--reduce-memory-overheads'
     This option reduces GAS's memory requirements, at the expense of
     making the assembly processes slower.  Currently this switch is a
     synonym for `--hash-size=4051', but in the future it may have
     other effects as well.

`--sectname-subst'
     Honor substitution sequences in section names.  *Note `.section
     NAME': Section Name Substitutions.

`-m68881 | -m68882 | -mno-68881 | -mno-68882'
     The target machine does (or does not) have a floating-point
     coprocessor.  The default is to assume a coprocessor for 68020,
     68030, and cpu32.  Although the basic 68000 is not compatible with
     the 68881, a combination of the two can be specified, since it's
     possible to do emulation of the coprocessor instructions with the
     main processor.

`-m68851 | -mno-68851'
     The target machine does (or does not) have a memory-management

     `-mips64r2', `-mips64r3', `-mips64r5', and `-mips64r6' correspond
     to generic MIPS V, MIPS32, MIPS32 Release 2, MIPS32 Release 3,
     MIPS32 Release 5, MIPS32 Release 6, MIPS64, MIPS64 Release 2,
     MIPS64 Release 3, MIPS64 Release 5, and MIPS64 Release 6 ISA
     processors, respectively.

     Cause nops to be inserted if a dmult or dmultu instruction is
     followed by a load instruction.

`-mdebug'
`-no-mdebug'
     Cause stabs-style debugging output to go into an ECOFF-style
     .mdebug section instead of the standard ELF .stabs sections.

`-mpdr'
`-mno-pdr'
     Control generation of `.pdr' sections.

`-mgp32'
`-mfp32'
     The register sizes are normally inferred from the ISA and ABI, but
     these flags force a certain group of registers to be treated as 32
     bits wide at all times.  `-mgp32' controls the size of
     general-purpose registers and `-mfp32' controls the size of
     floating-point registers.

`-mgp64'
`-mfp64'
     The register sizes are normally inferred from the ISA and ABI, but
     these flags force a certain group of registers to be treated as 64
     bits wide at all times.  `-mgp64' controls the size of
     general-purpose registers and `-mfp64' controls the size of
     floating-point registers.

`-mfpxx'
     The register sizes are normally inferred from the ISA and ABI, but
     using this flag in combination with `-mabi=32' enables an ABI
     variant which will operate correctly with floating-point registers
     which are 32 or 64 bits wide.

`-modd-spreg'
`-mno-odd-spreg'
     Enable use of floating-point operations on odd-numbered
     single-precision registers when supported by the ISA.  `-mfpxx'
     implies `-mno-odd-spreg', otherwise the default is `-modd-spreg'.

`-mips16'
`-no-mips16'
     Generate code for the MIPS 16 processor.  This is equivalent to
     putting `.module mips16' at the start of the assembly file.
     `-no-mips16' turns off this option.

`-mmips16e2'
`-mno-mips16e2'
     Enable the use of MIPS16e2 instructions in MIPS16 mode.  This is
     equivalent to putting `.module mips16e2' at the start of the
     assembly file.  `-mno-mips16e2' turns off this option.

`-mmicromips'
`-mno-micromips'
     Generate code for the microMIPS processor.  This is equivalent to
     putting `.module micromips' at the start of the assembly file.
     `-mno-micromips' turns off this option.  This is equivalent to
     putting `.module nomicromips' at the start of the assembly file.

`-msmartmips'
`-mno-smartmips'
     Enables the SmartMIPS extension to the MIPS32 instruction set.
     This is equivalent to putting `.module smartmips' at the start of
     the assembly file.  `-mno-smartmips' turns off this option.

`-mips3d'
`-no-mips3d'
     Generate code for the MIPS-3D Application Specific Extension.
     This tells the assembler to accept MIPS-3D instructions.
     `-no-mips3d' turns off this option.

`-mdmx'
`-no-mdmx'
     Generate code for the MDMX Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MDMX instructions.  `-no-mdmx' turns
     off this option.

`-mdsp'
`-mno-dsp'
     Generate code for the DSP Release 1 Application Specific Extension.
     This tells the assembler to accept DSP Release 1 instructions.
     `-mno-dsp' turns off this option.

`-mdspr2'
`-mno-dspr2'
     Generate code for the DSP Release 2 Application Specific Extension.
     This option implies `-mdsp'.  This tells the assembler to accept
     DSP Release 2 instructions.  `-mno-dspr2' turns off this option.

`-mdspr3'
`-mno-dspr3'
     Generate code for the DSP Release 3 Application Specific Extension.
     This option implies `-mdsp' and `-mdspr2'.  This tells the
     assembler to accept DSP Release 3 instructions.  `-mno-dspr3'
     turns off this option.

`-mmsa'
`-mno-msa'
     Generate code for the MIPS SIMD Architecture Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MSA instructions.  `-mno-msa' turns
     off this option.

`-mxpa'
`-mno-xpa'
     Generate code for the MIPS eXtended Physical Address (XPA)
     Extension.  This tells the assembler to accept XPA instructions.
     `-mno-xpa' turns off this option.

`-mmt'
`-mno-mt'
     Generate code for the MT Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MT instructions.  `-mno-mt' turns
     off this option.

`-mmcu'
`-mno-mcu'
     Generate code for the MCU Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MCU instructions.  `-mno-mcu' turns
     off this option.

`-minsn32'
`-mno-insn32'
     Only use 32-bit instruction encodings when generating code for the
     microMIPS processor.  This option inhibits the use of any 16-bit
     instructions.  This is equivalent to putting `.set insn32' at the
     start of the assembly file.  `-mno-insn32' turns off this option.
     This is equivalent to putting `.set noinsn32' at the start of the
     assembly file.  By default `-mno-insn32' is selected, allowing all
     instructions to be used.

`--construct-floats'
`--no-construct-floats'
     The `--no-construct-floats' option disables the construction of
     double width floating point constants by loading the two halves of
     the value into the two single width floating point registers that
     make up the double width register.  By default
     `--construct-floats' is selected, allowing construction of these
     floating point constants.

`--relax-branch'
`--no-relax-branch'
     The `--relax-branch' option enables the relaxation of out-of-range
     branches.  By default `--no-relax-branch' is selected, causing any
     out-of-range branches to produce an error.

`-mignore-branch-isa'
`-mno-ignore-branch-isa'
     Ignore branch checks for invalid transitions between ISA modes.
     The semantics of branches does not provide for an ISA mode switch,
     so in most cases the ISA mode a branch has been encoded for has to
     be the same as the ISA mode of the branch's target label.
     Therefore GAS has checks implemented that verify in branch
     assembly that the two ISA modes match.  `-mignore-branch-isa'
     disables these checks.  By default `-mno-ignore-branch-isa' is
     selected, causing any invalid branch requiring a transition
     between ISA modes to produce an error.

`-mnan=ENCODING'
     Select between the IEEE 754-2008 (`-mnan=2008') or the legacy
     (`-mnan=legacy') NaN encoding format.  The latter is the default.

`--emulation=NAME'
     This option was formerly used to switch between ELF and ECOFF
     output on targets like IRIX 5 that supported both.  MIPS ECOFF
     support was removed in GAS 2.24, so the option now serves little
     purpose.  It is retained for backwards compatibility.

     The available configuration names are: `mipself', `mipslelf' and
     `mipsbelf'.  Choosing `mipself' now has no effect, since the output
     is always ELF.  `mipslelf' and `mipsbelf' select little- and
     big-endian output respectively, but `-EL' and `-EB' are now the
     preferred options instead.

`-nocpp'
     `as' ignores this option.  It is accepted for compatibility with
     the native tools.

`--trap'
`--no-trap'
`--break'
`--no-break'
     Control how to deal with multiplication overflow and division by
     zero.  `--trap' or `--no-break' (which are synonyms) take a trap
     exception (and only work for Instruction Set Architecture level 2
     and higher); `--break' or `--no-trap' (also synonyms, and the
     default) take a break exception.

`-n'
     When this option is used, `as' will issue a warning every time it
     generates a nop instruction from a macro.

   The following options are available when as is configured for an
MCore processor.

`-jsri2bsr'
`-nojsri2bsr'
     Enable or disable the JSRI to BSR transformation.  By default this
     is enabled.  The command line option `-nojsri2bsr' can be used to
     disable it.

`-sifilter'
`-nosifilter'
     Enable or disable the silicon filter behaviour.  By default this
     is disabled.  The default can be overridden by the `-sifilter'
     command line option.

`-relax'
     Alter jump instructions for long displacements.

`-mcpu=[210|340]'
     Select the cpu type on the target hardware.  This controls which
     instructions can be assembled.

`-EB'
     Assemble for a big endian target.

`-EL'
     Assemble for a little endian target.

1.1 Structure of this Manual
============================

This manual is intended to describe what you need to know to use GNU
`as'.  We cover the syntax expected in source files, including notation
for symbols, constants, and expressions; the directives that `as'
understands; and of course how to invoke `as'.

   This manual also describes some of the machine-dependent features of
various flavors of the assembler.

   On the other hand, this manual is _not_ intended as an introduction
to programming in assembly language--let alone programming in general!
In a similar vein, we make no attempt to introduce the machine
architecture; we do _not_ describe the instruction set, standard
mnemonics, registers or addressing modes that are standard to a
particular architecture.  You may want to consult the manufacturer's
machine architecture manual for this information.

1.2 The GNU Assembler
=====================

GNU `as' is really a family of assemblers.  If you use (or have used)
the GNU assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar
environment when you use it on another architecture.  Each version has
much in common with the others, including object file formats, most
assembler directives (often called "pseudo-ops") and assembler syntax.

   `as' is primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C
compiler `gcc' for use by the linker `ld'.  Nevertheless, we've tried
to make `as' assemble correctly everything that other assemblers for
the same machine would assemble.  Any exceptions are documented
explicitly (*note Machine Dependencies::).  This doesn't mean `as'
always uses the same syntax as another assembler for the same
architecture; for example, we know of several incompatible versions of
680x0 assembly language syntax.

   Unlike older assemblers, `as' is designed to assemble a source
program in one pass of the source file.  This has a subtle impact on the
`.org' directive (*note `.org': Org.).

1.3 Object File Formats
=======================

The GNU assembler can be configured to produce several alternative
object file formats.  For the most part, this does not affect how you
write assembly language programs; but directives for debugging symbols
are typically different in different file formats.  *Note Symbol
Attributes: Symbol Attributes.


File: as.info,  Node: Command Line,  Next: Input Files,  Prev: Object Formats,  Up: Overview

1.4 Command Line
================

After the program name `as', the command line may contain options and
file names.  Options may appear in any order, and may be before, after,
or between file names.  The order of file names is significant.

   `--' (two hyphens) by itself names the standard input file
explicitly, as one of the files for `as' to assemble.

   Except for `--' any command line argument that begins with a hyphen
(`-') is an option.  Each option changes the behavior of `as'.  No
option changes the way another option works.  An option is a `-'
followed by one or more letters; the case of the letter is important.
All options are optional.

   Some options expect exactly one file name to follow them.  The file
name may either immediately follow the option's letter (compatible with
older assemblers) or it may be the next command argument (GNU
standard).  These two command lines are equivalent:

     as -o my-object-file.o mumble.s
     as -omy-object-file.o mumble.s

1.5 Input Files
===============

We use the phrase "source program", abbreviated "source", to describe
the program input to one run of `as'.  The program may be in one or
more files; how the source is partitioned into files doesn't change the
meaning of the source.

   The source program is a concatenation of the text in all the files,
in the order specified.

   Each time you run `as' it assembles exactly one source program.  The
source program is made up of one or more files.  (The standard input is
also a file.)

   You give `as' a command line that has zero or more input file names.
The input files are read (from left file name to right).  A command
line argument (in any position) that has no special meaning is taken to
be an input file name.

   If you give `as' no file names it attempts to read one input file
from the `as' standard input, which is normally your terminal.  You may
have to type <ctl-D> to tell `as' there is no more program to assemble.

   Use `--' if you need to explicitly name the standard input file in
your command line.

   If the source is empty, `as' produces a small, empty object file.

Filenames and Line-numbers
--------------------------

There are two ways of locating a line in the input file (or files) and
either may be used in reporting error messages.  One way refers to a
line number in a physical file; the other refers to a line number in a
"logical" file.  *Note Error and Warning Messages: Errors.

   "Physical files" are those files named in the command line given to
`as'.

   "Logical files" are simply names declared explicitly by assembler
directives; they bear no relation to physical files.  Logical file
names help error messages reflect the original source file, when `as'
source is itself synthesized from other files.  `as' understands the
`#' directives emitted by the `gcc' preprocessor.  See also *Note
`.file': File.


File: as.info,  Node: Object,  Next: Errors,  Prev: Input Files,  Up: Overview

1.6 Output (Object) File
========================

Every time you run `as' it produces an output file, which is your
assembly language program translated into numbers.  This file is the
object file.  Its default name is `a.out'.  You can give it another
name by using the `-o' option.  Conventionally, object file names end
with `.o'.  The default name is used for historical reasons: older
assemblers were capable of assembling self-contained programs directly
into a runnable program.  (For some formats, this isn't currently
possible, but it can be done for the `a.out' format.)

   The object file is meant for input to the linker `ld'.  It contains
assembled program code, information to help `ld' integrate the
assembled program into a runnable file, and (optionally) symbolic
information for the debugger.


File: as.info,  Node: Errors,  Prev: Object,  Up: Overview

1.7 Error and Warning Messages
==============================

`as' may write warnings and error messages to the standard error file
(usually your terminal).  This should not happen when  a compiler runs
`as' automatically.  Warnings report an assumption made so that `as'
could keep assembling a flawed program; errors report a grave problem
that stops the assembly.

   Warning messages have the format

     file_name:NNN:Warning Message Text

(where NNN is a line number).  If both a logical file name (*note
`.file': File.) and a logical line number (*note `.line': Line.)  have
been given then they will be used, otherwise the file name and line
number in the current assembler source file will be used.  The message
text is intended to be self explanatory (in the grand Unix tradition).

   Note the file name must be set via the logical version of the `.file'
directive, not the DWARF2 version of the `.file' directive.  For
example:

       .file 2 "bar.c"
          error_assembler_source
       .file "foo.c"
       .line 30
           error_c_source

   produces this output:

       Assembler messages:
       asm.s:2: Error: no such instruction: `error_assembler_source'
       foo.c:31: Error: no such instruction: `error_c_source'

   Error messages have the format

     file_name:NNN:FATAL:Error Message Text

   The file name and line number are derived as for warning messages.
The actual message text may be rather less explanatory because many of
them aren't supposed to happen.

2 Command-Line Options
**********************

This chapter describes command-line options available in _all_ versions
of the GNU assembler; see *Note Machine Dependencies::, for options
specific to particular machine architectures.

   If you are invoking `as' via the GNU C compiler, you can use the
`-Wa' option to pass arguments through to the assembler.  The assembler
arguments must be separated from each other (and the `-Wa') by commas.
For example:

     gcc -c -g -O -Wa,-alh,-L file.c

This passes two options to the assembler: `-alh' (emit a listing to
standard output with high-level and assembly source) and `-L' (retain
local symbols in the symbol table).

   Usually you do not need to use this `-Wa' mechanism, since many
compiler command-line options are automatically passed to the assembler
by the compiler.  (You can call the GNU compiler driver with the `-v'
option to see precisely what options it passes to each compilation
pass, including the assembler.)

* Menu:

* a::             -a[cdghlns] enable listings
* alternate::     --alternate enable alternate macro syntax

* K::             -K for difference tables

* L::             -L to retain local symbols

* MD::            --MD for dependency tracking
* no-pad-sections:: --no-pad-sections to stop section padding
* o::             -o to name the object file
* R::             -R to join data and text sections

File: as.info,  Node: a,  Next: alternate,  Up: Invoking

2.1 Enable Listings: `-a[cdghlns]'
==================================

These options enable listing output from the assembler.  By itself,
`-a' requests high-level, assembly, and symbols listing.  You can use
other letters to select specific options for the list: `-ah' requests a
high-level language listing, `-al' requests an output-program assembly
listing, and `-as' requests a symbol table listing.  High-level
listings require that a compiler debugging option like `-g' be used,
and that assembly listings (`-al') be requested also.

   Use the `-ag' option to print a first section with general assembly
information, like as version, switches passed, or time stamp.

   Use the `-ac' option to omit false conditionals from a listing.  Any
lines which are not assembled because of a false `.if' (or `.ifdef', or
any other conditional), or a true `.if' followed by an `.else', will be
omitted from the listing.

   Use the `-ad' option to omit debugging directives from the listing.

   Once you have specified one of these options, you can further control
listing output and its appearance using the directives `.list',
`.nolist', `.psize', `.eject', `.title', and `.sbttl'.  The `-an'
option turns off all forms processing.  If you do not request listing
output with one of the `-a' options, the listing-control directives
have no effect.

   The letters after `-a' may be combined into one option, _e.g._,
`-aln'.

   Note if the assembler source is coming from the standard input (e.g.,
because it is being created by `gcc' and the `-pipe' command line switch
is being used) then the listing will not contain any comments or
preprocessor directives.  This is because the listing code buffers
input source lines from stdin only after they have been preprocessed by
the assembler.  This reduces memory usage and makes the code more
efficient.

2.2 `--alternate'
=================

Begin in alternate macro mode, see *Note `.altmacro': Altmacro.


File: as.info,  Node: D,  Next: f,  Prev: alternate,  Up: Invoking

2.3 `-D'
========

This option has no effect whatsoever, but it is accepted to make it more
likely that scripts written for other assemblers also work with `as'.


File: as.info,  Node: f,  Next: I,  Prev: D,  Up: Invoking

2.4 Work Faster: `-f'
=====================

`-f' should only be used when assembling programs written by a
(trusted) compiler.  `-f' stops the assembler from doing whitespace and
comment preprocessing on the input file(s) before assembling them.
*Note Preprocessing: Preprocessing.

     _Warning:_ if you use `-f' when the files actually need to be
     preprocessed (if they contain comments, for example), `as' does
     not work correctly.


File: as.info,  Node: I,  Next: K,  Prev: f,  Up: Invoking

2.5 `.include' Search Path: `-I' PATH
=====================================

Use this option to add a PATH to the list of directories `as' searches
for files specified in `.include' directives (*note `.include':
Include.).  You may use `-I' as many times as necessary to include a
variety of paths.  The current working directory is always searched
first; after that, `as' searches any `-I' directories in the same order
as they were specified (left to right) on the command line.


File: as.info,  Node: K,  Next: L,  Prev: I,  Up: Invoking

2.6 Difference Tables: `-K'
===========================

`as' sometimes alters the code emitted for directives of the form
`.word SYM1-SYM2'.  *Note `.word': Word.  You can use the `-K' option
if you want a warning issued when this is done.


File: as.info,  Node: L,  Next: listing,  Prev: K,  Up: Invoking

2.7 Include Local Symbols: `-L'
===============================

Symbols beginning with system-specific local label prefixes, typically
`.L' for ELF systems or `L' for traditional a.out systems, are called
"local symbols".  *Note Symbol Names::.  Normally you do not see such
symbols when debugging, because they are intended for the use of
programs (like compilers) that compose assembler programs, not for your
notice.  Normally both `as' and `ld' discard such symbols, so you do
not normally debug with them.

   This option tells `as' to retain those local symbols in the object
file.  Usually if you do this you also tell the linker `ld' to preserve
those symbols.


File: as.info,  Node: listing,  Next: M,  Prev: L,  Up: Invoking

2.8 Configuring listing output: `--listing'
===========================================

The listing feature of the assembler can be enabled via the command
line switch `-a' (*note a::).  This feature combines the input source
file(s) with a hex dump of the corresponding locations in the output
object file, and displays them as a listing file.  The format of this
listing can be controlled by directives inside the assembler source
(i.e., `.list' (*note List::), `.title' (*note Title::), `.sbttl'
(*note Sbttl::), `.psize' (*note Psize::), and `.eject' (*note Eject::)
and also by the following switches:

`--listing-lhs-width=`number''
     Sets the maximum width, in words, of the first line of the hex
     byte dump.  This dump appears on the left hand side of the listing
     output.

`--listing-lhs-width2=`number''
     Sets the maximum width, in words, of any further lines of the hex
     byte dump for a given input source line.  If this value is not
     specified, it defaults to being the same as the value specified
     for `--listing-lhs-width'.  If neither switch is used the default
     is to one.

`--listing-rhs-width=`number''
     Sets the maximum width, in characters, of the source line that is
     displayed alongside the hex dump.  The default value for this
     parameter is 100.  The source line is displayed on the right hand
     side of the listing output.

`--listing-cont-lines=`number''
     Sets the maximum number of continuation lines of hex dump that
     will be displayed for a given single line of source input.  The
     default value is 4.


File: as.info,  Node: M,  Next: MD,  Prev: listing,  Up: Invoking

2.9 Assemble in MRI Compatibility Mode: `-M'
============================================

The `-M' or `--mri' option selects MRI compatibility mode.  This
changes the syntax and pseudo-op handling of `as' to make it compatible
with the `ASM68K' or the `ASM960' (depending upon the configured
target) assembler from Microtec Research.  The exact nature of the MRI
syntax will not be documented here; see the MRI manuals for more
information.  Note in particular that the handling of macros and macro
arguments is somewhat different.  The purpose of this option is to
permit assembling existing MRI assembler code using `as'.

   The MRI compatibility is not complete.  Certain operations of the
MRI assembler depend upon its object file format, and can not be
supported using other object file formats.  Supporting these would
require enhancing each object file format individually.  These are:

   * global symbols in common section

     The m68k MRI assembler supports common sections which are merged
     by the linker.  Other object file formats do not support this.
     `as' handles common sections by treating them as a single common
     symbol.  It permits local symbols to be defined within a common
     section, but it can not support global symbols, since it has no
     way to describe them.

   * complex relocations

     The MRI assemblers support relocations against a negated section
     address, and relocations which combine the start addresses of two
     or more sections.  These are not support by other object file
     formats.

   * `END' pseudo-op specifying start address

     The MRI `END' pseudo-op permits the specification of a start
     address.  This is not supported by other object file formats.  The
     start address may instead be specified using the `-e' option to
     the linker, or in a linker script.

   * `IDNT', `.ident' and `NAME' pseudo-ops

     The MRI `IDNT', `.ident' and `NAME' pseudo-ops assign a module
     name to the output file.  This is not supported by other object
     file formats.

   * `ORG' pseudo-op

     The m68k MRI `ORG' pseudo-op begins an absolute section at a given
     address.  This differs from the usual `as' `.org' pseudo-op, which
     changes the location within the current section.  Absolute
     sections are not supported by other object file formats.  The
     address of a section may be assigned within a linker script.

   There are some other features of the MRI assembler which are not
supported by `as', typically either because they are difficult or
because they seem of little consequence.  Some of these may be
supported in future releases.

   * EBCDIC strings

     EBCDIC strings are not supported.

   * packed binary coded decimal

     Packed binary coded decimal is not supported.  This means that the
     `DC.P' and `DCB.P' pseudo-ops are not supported.

   * `FEQU' pseudo-op

     The m68k `FEQU' pseudo-op is not supported.

   * `NOOBJ' pseudo-op

     The m68k `NOOBJ' pseudo-op is not supported.

   * `OPT' branch control options

     The m68k `OPT' branch control options--`B', `BRS', `BRB', `BRL',
     and `BRW'--are ignored.  `as' automatically relaxes all branches,
     whether forward or backward, to an appropriate size, so these
     options serve no purpose.

   * `OPT' list control options

     The following m68k `OPT' list control options are ignored: `C',
     `CEX', `CL', `CRE', `E', `G', `I', `M', `MEX', `MC', `MD', `X'.

   * other `OPT' options

     The following m68k `OPT' options are ignored: `NEST', `O', `OLD',
     `OP', `P', `PCO', `PCR', `PCS', `R'.

   * `OPT' `D' option is default

     The m68k `OPT' `D' option is the default, unlike the MRI assembler.
     `OPT NOD' may be used to turn it off.

   * `XREF' pseudo-op.

     The m68k `XREF' pseudo-op is ignored.

   * `.debug' pseudo-op

     The i960 `.debug' pseudo-op is not supported.

   * `.extended' pseudo-op

     The i960 `.extended' pseudo-op is not supported.

   * `.list' pseudo-op.

     The various options of the i960 `.list' pseudo-op are not
     supported.

   * `.optimize' pseudo-op

     The i960 `.optimize' pseudo-op is not supported.

   * `.output' pseudo-op

     The i960 `.output' pseudo-op is not supported.

   * `.setreal' pseudo-op

     The i960 `.setreal' pseudo-op is not supported.

2.10 Dependency Tracking: `--MD'
================================

`as' can generate a dependency file for the file it creates.  This file
consists of a single rule suitable for `make' describing the
dependencies of the main source file.

   The rule is written to the file named in its argument.

   This feature is used in the automatic updating of makefiles.


File: as.info,  Node: no-pad-sections,  Next: o,  Prev: MD,  Up: Invoking

2.11 Output Section Padding
===========================

Normally the assembler will pad the end of each output section up to its
alignment boundary.  But this can waste space, which can be significant
on memory constrained targets.  So the `--no-pad-sections' option will
disable this behaviour.


File: as.info,  Node: o,  Next: R,  Prev: no-pad-sections,  Up: Invoking

2.12 Name the Object File: `-o'
===============================

There is always one object file output when you run `as'.  By default
it has the name `a.out' (or `b.out', for Intel 960 targets only).  You
use this option (which takes exactly one filename) to give the object
file a different name.

   Whatever the object file is called, `as' overwrites any existing
file of the same name.


File: as.info,  Node: R,  Next: statistics,  Prev: o,  Up: Invoking

2.13 Join Data and Text Sections: `-R'
======================================

`-R' tells `as' to write the object file as if all data-section data
lives in the text section.  This is only done at the very last moment:
your binary data are the same, but data section parts are relocated
differently.  The data section part of your object file is zero bytes
long because all its bytes are appended to the text section.  (*Note
Sections and Relocation: Sections.)

   When you specify `-R' it would be possible to generate shorter
address displacements (because we do not have to cross between text and
data section).  We refrain from doing this simply for compatibility with
older versions of `as'.  In future, `-R' may work this way.

   When `as' is configured for COFF or ELF output, this option is only
useful if you use sections named `.text' and `.data'.

   `-R' is not supported for any of the HPPA targets.  Using `-R'
generates a warning from `as'.


File: as.info,  Node: statistics,  Next: traditional-format,  Prev: R,  Up: Invoking

2.14 Display Assembly Statistics: `--statistics'
================================================

Use `--statistics' to display two statistics about the resources used by
`as': the maximum amount of space allocated during the assembly (in
bytes), and the total execution time taken for the assembly (in CPU
seconds).


File: as.info,  Node: traditional-format,  Next: v,  Prev: statistics,  Up: Invoking

2.15 Compatible Output: `--traditional-format'
==============================================

For some targets, the output of `as' is different in some ways from the
output of some existing assembler.  This switch requests `as' to use
the traditional format instead.

   For example, it disables the exception frame optimizations which
`as' normally does by default on `gcc' output.


File: as.info,  Node: v,  Next: W,  Prev: traditional-format,  Up: Invoking

2.16 Announce Version: `-v'
===========================

You can find out what version of as is running by including the option
`-v' (which you can also spell as `-version') on the command line.


File: as.info,  Node: W,  Next: Z,  Prev: v,  Up: Invoking

2.17 Control Warnings: `-W', `--warn', `--no-warn', `--fatal-warnings'
======================================================================

`as' should never give a warning or error message when assembling
compiler output.  But programs written by people often cause `as' to
give a warning that a particular assumption was made.  All such
warnings are directed to the standard error file.

   If you use the `-W' and `--no-warn' options, no warnings are issued.
This only affects the warning messages: it does not change any
particular of how `as' assembles your file.  Errors, which stop the
assembly, are still reported.

   If you use the `--fatal-warnings' option, `as' considers files that
generate warnings to be in error.

   You can switch these options off again by specifying `--warn', which
causes warnings to be output as usual.


File: as.info,  Node: Z,  Prev: W,  Up: Invoking

2.18 Generate Object File in Spite of Errors: `-Z'
==================================================

After an error message, `as' normally produces no output.  If for some
reason you are interested in object file output even after `as' gives
an error message on your program, use the `-Z' option.  If there are
any errors, `as' continues anyways, and writes an object file after a
final warning message of the form `N errors, M warnings, generating bad
object file.'

3 Syntax
********

This chapter describes the machine-independent syntax allowed in a
source file.  `as' syntax is similar to what many other assemblers use;
it is inspired by the BSD 4.2 assembler, except that `as' does not
assemble Vax bit-fields.

* Menu:

* Preprocessing::               Preprocessing
* Whitespace::                  Whitespace
* Comments::                    Comments
* Symbol Intro::                Symbols
* Statements::                  Statements
* Constants::                   Constants


File: as.info,  Node: Preprocessing,  Next: Whitespace,  Up: Syntax

3.1 Preprocessing
=================

The `as' internal preprocessor:
   * adjusts and removes extra whitespace.  It leaves one space or tab
     before the keywords on a line, and turns any other whitespace on
     the line into a single space.

   * removes all comments, replacing them with a single space, or an
     appropriate number of newlines.

   * converts character constants into the appropriate numeric values.

   It does not do macro processing, include file handling, or anything
else you may get from your C compiler's preprocessor.  You can do
include file processing with the `.include' directive (*note
`.include': Include.).  You can use the GNU C compiler driver to get
other "CPP" style preprocessing by giving the input file a `.S' suffix.
*Note Options Controlling the Kind of Output: (gcc info)Overall
Options.

   Excess whitespace, comments, and character constants cannot be used
in the portions of the input text that are not preprocessed.

   If the first line of an input file is `#NO_APP' or if you use the
`-f' option, whitespace and comments are not removed from the input
file.  Within an input file, you can ask for whitespace and comment
removal in specific portions of the by putting a line that says `#APP'
before the text that may contain whitespace or comments, and putting a
line that says `#NO_APP' after this text.  This feature is mainly
intend to support `asm' statements in compilers whose output is
otherwise free of comments and whitespace.

3.2 Whitespace
==============

"Whitespace" is one or more blanks or tabs, in any order.  Whitespace
is used to separate symbols, and to make programs neater for people to
read.  Unless within character constants (*note Character Constants:
Characters.), any whitespace means the same as exactly one space.


File: as.info,  Node: Comments,  Next: Symbol Intro,  Prev: Whitespace,  Up: Syntax

3.3 Comments
============

There are two ways of rendering comments to `as'.  In both cases the
comment is equivalent to one space.

   Anything from `/*' through the next `*/' is a comment.  This means
you may not nest these comments.

     /*
       The only way to include a newline ('\n') in a comment
       is to use this sort of comment.
     */

     /* This sort of comment does not nest. */

   Anything from a "line comment" character up to the next newline is
considered a comment and is ignored.  The line comment character is
target specific, and some targets multiple comment characters.  Some
targets also have line comment characters that only work if they are
the first character on a line.  Some targets use a sequence of two
characters to introduce a line comment.  Some targets can also change
their line comment characters depending upon command line options that
have been used.  For more details see the _Syntax_ section in the
documentation for individual targets.

   If the line comment character is the hash sign (`#') then it still
has the special ability to enable and disable preprocessing (*note
Preprocessing::) and to specify logical line numbers:

   To be compatible with past assemblers, lines that begin with `#'
have a special interpretation.  Following the `#' should be an absolute
expression (*note Expressions::): the logical line number of the _next_
line.  Then a string (*note Strings: Strings.) is allowed: if present
it is a new logical file name.  The rest of the line, if any, should be
whitespace.

   If the first non-whitespace characters on the line are not numeric,
the line is ignored.  (Just like a comment.)

                               # This is an ordinary comment.
     # 42-6 "new_file_name"    # New logical file name
                               # This is logical line # 36.
   This feature is deprecated, and may disappear from future versions
of `as'.

3.4 Symbols
===========

A "symbol" is one or more characters chosen from the set of all letters
(both upper and lower case), digits and the three characters `_.$'.  On
most machines, you can also use `$' in symbol names; exceptions are
noted in *Note Machine Dependencies::.  No symbol may begin with a
digit.  Case is significant.  There is no length limit; all characters
are significant.  Multibyte characters are supported.  Symbols are
delimited by characters not in that set, or by the beginning of a file
(since the source program must end with a newline, the end of a file is
not a possible symbol delimiter).  *Note Symbols::.

Symbol names may also be enclosed in double quote `"' characters.  In
such cases any characters are allowed, except for the NUL character.
If a double quote character is to be included in the symbol name it
must be preceeded by a backslash `\' character.  


File: as.info,  Node: Statements,  Next: Constants,  Prev: Symbol Intro,  Up: Syntax

3.5 Statements
==============

A "statement" ends at a newline character (`\n') or a "line separator
character".  The line separator character is target specific and
described in the _Syntax_ section of each target's documentation.  Not
all targets support a line separator character.  The newline or line
separator character is considered to be part of the preceding
statement.  Newlines and separators within character constants are an
exception: they do not end statements.

   It is an error to end any statement with end-of-file:  the last
character of any input file should be a newline.

   An empty statement is allowed, and may include whitespace.  It is
ignored.

   A statement begins with zero or more labels, optionally followed by a
key symbol which determines what kind of statement it is.  The key
symbol determines the syntax of the rest of the statement.  If the
symbol begins with a dot `.' then the statement is an assembler
directive: typically valid for any computer.  If the symbol begins with
a letter the statement is an assembly language "instruction": it
assembles into a machine language instruction.  Different versions of
`as' for different computers recognize different instructions.  In
fact, the same symbol may represent a different instruction in a
different computer's assembly language.

   A label is a symbol immediately followed by a colon (`:').
Whitespace before a label or after a colon is permitted, but you may not
have whitespace between a label's symbol and its colon. *Note Labels::.

   For HPPA targets, labels need not be immediately followed by a
colon, but the definition of a label must begin in column zero.  This
also implies that only one label may be defined on each line.

     label:     .directive    followed by something
     another_label:           # This is an empty statement.
                instruction   operand_1, operand_2, ...

A constant is a number, written so that its value is known by
inspection, without knowing any context.  Like this:

3.6.1 Character Constants
-------------------------

There are two kinds of character constants.  A "character" stands for
one character in one byte and its value may be used in numeric
expressions.  String constants (properly called string _literals_) are
potentially many bytes and their values may not be used in arithmetic
expressions.

File: as.info,  Node: Strings,  Next: Chars,  Up: Characters

3.6.1.1 Strings
...............

A "string" is written between double-quotes.  It may contain
double-quotes or null characters.  The way to get special characters
into a string is to "escape" these characters: precede them with a
backslash `\' character.  For example `\\' represents one backslash:
the first `\' is an escape which tells `as' to interpret the second
character literally as a backslash (which prevents `as' from
recognizing the second `\' as an escape character).  The complete list
of escapes follows.

`\b'
     Mnemonic for backspace; for ASCII this is octal code 010.

`backslash-f'
     Mnemonic for FormFeed; for ASCII this is octal code 014.

`\n'
     Mnemonic for newline; for ASCII this is octal code 012.

`\r'
     Mnemonic for carriage-Return; for ASCII this is octal code 015.

`\t'
     Mnemonic for horizontal Tab; for ASCII this is octal code 011.

`\ DIGIT DIGIT DIGIT'
     An octal character code.  The numeric code is 3 octal digits.  For
     compatibility with other Unix systems, 8 and 9 are accepted as
     digits: for example, `\008' has the value 010, and `\009' the
     value 011.

`\`x' HEX-DIGITS...'
     A hex character code.  All trailing hex digits are combined.
     Either upper or lower case `x' works.

`\\'
     Represents one `\' character.

`\"'
     Represents one `"' character.  Needed in strings to represent this
     character, because an unescaped `"' would end the string.

`\ ANYTHING-ELSE'
     Any other character when escaped by `\' gives a warning, but
     assembles as if the `\' was not present.  The idea is that if you
     used an escape sequence you clearly didn't want the literal
     interpretation of the following character.  However `as' has no
     other interpretation, so `as' knows it is giving you the wrong
     code and warns you of the fact.

   Which characters are escapable, and what those escapes represent,
varies widely among assemblers.  The current set is what we think the
BSD 4.2 assembler recognizes, and is a subset of what most C compilers
recognize.  If you are in doubt, do not use an escape sequence.


File: as.info,  Node: Chars,  Prev: Strings,  Up: Characters

3.6.1.2 Characters
..................

A single character may be written as a single quote immediately
followed by that character.  Some backslash escapes apply to
characters, `\b', `\f', `\n', `\r', `\t', and `\"' with the same meaning
as for strings, plus `\'' for a single quote.  So if you want to write
the character backslash, you must write `'\\' where the first `\'
escapes the second `\'.  As you can see, the quote is an acute accent,
not a grave accent.  A newline immediately following an acute accent is
taken as a literal character and does not count as the end of a
statement.  The value of a character constant in a numeric expression
is the machine's byte-wide code for that character.  `as' assumes your
character code is ASCII: `'A' means 65, `'B' means 66, and so on.

3.6.2 Number Constants
----------------------

`as' distinguishes three kinds of numbers according to how they are
stored in the target machine.  _Integers_ are numbers that would fit
into an `int' in the C language.  _Bignums_ are integers, but they are
stored in more than 32 bits.  _Flonums_ are floating point numbers,
described below.

* Menu:

* Integers::                    Integers
* Bignums::                     Bignums

File: as.info,  Node: Integers,  Next: Bignums,  Up: Numbers

3.6.2.1 Integers
................

A binary integer is `0b' or `0B' followed by zero or more of the binary
digits `01'.

   An octal integer is `0' followed by zero or more of the octal digits
(`01234567').

   A decimal integer starts with a non-zero digit followed by zero or
more digits (`0123456789').

   A hexadecimal integer is `0x' or `0X' followed by one or more
hexadecimal digits chosen from `0123456789abcdefABCDEF'.

   Integers have the usual values.  To denote a negative integer, use
the prefix operator `-' discussed under expressions (*note Prefix
Operators: Prefix Ops.).


File: as.info,  Node: Bignums,  Next: Flonums,  Prev: Integers,  Up: Numbers

3.6.2.2 Bignums
...............

A "bignum" has the same syntax and semantics as an integer except that
the number (or its negative) takes more than 32 bits to represent in
binary.  The distinction is made because in some places integers are
permitted while bignums are not.


File: as.info,  Node: Flonums,  Prev: Bignums,  Up: Numbers

3.6.2.3 Flonums
...............

A "flonum" represents a floating point number.  The translation is
indirect: a decimal floating point number from the text is converted by
`as' to a generic binary floating point number of more than sufficient
precision.  This generic floating point number is converted to a
particular computer's floating point format (or formats) by a portion
of `as' specialized to that computer.

   A flonum is written by writing (in order)
   * The digit `0'.  (`0' is optional on the HPPA.)

   * A letter, to tell `as' the rest of the number is a flonum.  `e' is
     recommended.  Case is not important.

     On the H8/300, Renesas / SuperH SH, and AMD 29K architectures, the
     letter must be one of the letters `DFPRSX' (in upper or lower
     case).

     On the ARC, the letter must be one of the letters `DFRS' (in upper
     or lower case).

     On the Intel 960 architecture, the letter must be one of the
     letters `DFT' (in upper or lower case).

     On the HPPA architecture, the letter must be `E' (upper case only).

   * An optional sign: either `+' or `-'.

   * An optional "integer part": zero or more decimal digits.

   * An optional "fractional part": `.' followed by zero or more
     decimal digits.

   * An optional exponent, consisting of:

        * An `E' or `e'.

        * Optional sign: either `+' or `-'.

        * One or more decimal digits.


   At least one of the integer part or the fractional part must be
present.  The floating point number has the usual base-10 value.

   `as' does all processing using integers.  Flonums are computed
independently of any floating point hardware in the computer running
`as'.

File: as.info,  Node: Secs Background,  Next: Ld Sections,  Up: Sections

4.1 Background
==============

Roughly, a section is a range of addresses, with no gaps; all data "in"
those addresses is treated the same for some particular purpose.  For
example there may be a "read only" section.

   The linker `ld' reads many object files (partial programs) and
combines their contents to form a runnable program.  When `as' emits an
object file, the partial program is assumed to start at address 0.
`ld' assigns the final addresses for the partial program, so that
different partial programs do not overlap.  This is actually an
oversimplification, but it suffices to explain how `as' uses sections.

   `ld' moves blocks of bytes of your program to their run-time
addresses.  These blocks slide to their run-time addresses as rigid
units; their length does not change and neither does the order of bytes
within them.  Such a rigid unit is called a _section_.  Assigning
run-time addresses to sections is called "relocation".  It includes the
task of adjusting mentions of object-file addresses so they refer to
the proper run-time addresses.  For the H8/300, and for the Renesas /
SuperH SH, `as' pads sections if needed to ensure they end on a word
(sixteen bit) boundary.

   An object file written by `as' has at least three sections, any of
which may be empty.  These are named "text", "data" and "bss" sections.

   When it generates COFF or ELF output, `as' can also generate
whatever other named sections you specify using the `.section'
directive (*note `.section': Section.).  If you do not use any
directives that place output in the `.text' or `.data' sections, these
sections still exist, but are empty.

   When `as' generates SOM or ELF output for the HPPA, `as' can also
generate whatever other named sections you specify using the `.space'
and `.subspace' directives.  See `HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language
Reference Manual' (HP 92432-90001) for details on the `.space' and
`.subspace' assembler directives.

   Additionally, `as' uses different names for the standard text, data,
and bss sections when generating SOM output.  Program text is placed
into the `$CODE$' section, data into `$DATA$', and BSS into `$BSS$'.

   Within the object file, the text section starts at address `0', the
data section follows, and the bss section follows the data section.

   When generating either SOM or ELF output files on the HPPA, the text
section starts at address `0', the data section at address `0x4000000',
and the bss section follows the data section.

   To let `ld' know which data changes when the sections are relocated,
and how to change that data, `as' also writes to the object file
details of the relocation needed.  To perform relocation `ld' must
know, each time an address in the object file is mentioned:
   * Where in the object file is the beginning of this reference to an
     address?

   * How long (in bytes) is this reference?

   * Which section does the address refer to?  What is the numeric
     value of
          (ADDRESS) - (START-ADDRESS OF SECTION)?

   * Is the reference to an address "Program-Counter relative"?

   In fact, every address `as' ever uses is expressed as
     (SECTION) + (OFFSET INTO SECTION)
   Further, most expressions `as' computes have this section-relative
nature.  (For some object formats, such as SOM for the HPPA, some
expressions are symbol-relative instead.)

   In this manual we use the notation {SECNAME N} to mean "offset N
into section SECNAME."

   Apart from text, data and bss sections you need to know about the
"absolute" section.  When `ld' mixes partial programs, addresses in the
absolute section remain unchanged.  For example, address `{absolute 0}'
is "relocated" to run-time address 0 by `ld'.  Although the linker
never arranges two partial programs' data sections with overlapping
addresses after linking, _by definition_ their absolute sections must
overlap.  Address `{absolute 239}' in one part of a program is always
the same address when the program is running as address `{absolute
239}' in any other part of the program.

   The idea of sections is extended to the "undefined" section.  Any
address whose section is unknown at assembly time is by definition
rendered {undefined U}--where U is filled in later.  Since numbers are
always defined, the only way to generate an undefined address is to
mention an undefined symbol.  A reference to a named common block would
be such a symbol: its value is unknown at assembly time so it has
section _undefined_.

   By analogy the word _section_ is used to describe groups of sections
in the linked program.  `ld' puts all partial programs' text sections
in contiguous addresses in the linked program.  It is customary to
refer to the _text section_ of a program, meaning all the addresses of
all partial programs' text sections.  Likewise for data and bss
sections.

   Some sections are manipulated by `ld'; others are invented for use
of `as' and have no meaning except during assembly.

4.2 Linker Sections
===================

`ld' deals with just four kinds of sections, summarized below.

*named sections*
*text section*
*data section*
     These sections hold your program.  `as' and `ld' treat them as
     separate but equal sections.  Anything you can say of one section
     is true of another.  When the program is running, however, it is
     customary for the text section to be unalterable.  The text
     section is often shared among processes: it contains instructions,
     constants and the like.  The data section of a running program is
     usually alterable: for example, C variables would be stored in the
     data section.

*bss section*
     This section contains zeroed bytes when your program begins
     running.  It is used to hold uninitialized variables or common
     storage.  The length of each partial program's bss section is
     important, but because it starts out containing zeroed bytes there
     is no need to store explicit zero bytes in the object file.  The
     bss section was invented to eliminate those explicit zeros from
     object files.

*absolute section*
     Address 0 of this section is always "relocated" to runtime address
     0.  This is useful if you want to refer to an address that `ld'
     must not change when relocating.  In this sense we speak of
     absolute addresses being "unrelocatable": they do not change
     during relocation.

*undefined section*
     This "section" is a catch-all for address references to objects
     not in the preceding sections.

   An idealized example of three relocatable sections follows.  The
example uses the traditional section names `.text' and `.data'.  Memory
addresses are on the horizontal axis.

                           +-----+----+--+
     partial program # 1:  |ttttt|dddd|00|
                           +-----+----+--+

                           text   data bss
                           seg.   seg. seg.

                           +---+---+---+
     partial program # 2:  |TTT|DDD|000|
                           +---+---+---+

                           +--+---+-----+--+----+---+-----+~~
     linked program:       |  |TTT|ttttt|  |dddd|DDD|00000|
                           +--+---+-----+--+----+---+-----+~~

4.3 Assembler Internal Sections
===============================

These sections are meant only for the internal use of `as'.  They have
no meaning at run-time.  You do not really need to know about these
sections for most purposes; but they can be mentioned in `as' warning
messages, so it might be helpful to have an idea of their meanings to
`as'.  These sections are used to permit the value of every expression
in your assembly language program to be a section-relative address.

ASSEMBLER-INTERNAL-LOGIC-ERROR!
     An internal assembler logic error has been found.  This means
     there is a bug in the assembler.

expr section
     The assembler stores complex expression internally as combinations
     of symbols.  When it needs to represent an expression as a symbol,
     it puts it in the expr section.


File: as.info,  Node: Sub-Sections,  Next: bss,  Prev: As Sections,  Up: Sections

4.4 Sub-Sections
================

Assembled bytes conventionally fall into two sections: text and data.
You may have separate groups of data in named sections that you want to
end up near to each other in the object file, even though they are not
contiguous in the assembler source.  `as' allows you to use
"subsections" for this purpose.  Within each section, there can be
numbered subsections with values from 0 to 8192.  Objects assembled
into the same subsection go into the object file together with other
objects in the same subsection.  For example, a compiler might want to
store constants in the text section, but might not want to have them
interspersed with the program being assembled.  In this case, the
compiler could issue a `.text 0' before each section of code being
output, and a `.text 1' before each group of constants being output.

Subsections are optional.  If you do not use subsections, everything
goes in subsection number zero.

   Each subsection is zero-padded up to a multiple of four bytes.
(Subsections may be padded a different amount on different flavors of
`as'.)

   Subsections appear in your object file in numeric order, lowest
numbered to highest.  (All this to be compatible with other people's
assemblers.)  The object file contains no representation of
subsections; `ld' and other programs that manipulate object files see
no trace of them.  They just see all your text subsections as a text
section, and all your data subsections as a data section.

   To specify which subsection you want subsequent statements assembled
into, use a numeric argument to specify it, in a `.text EXPRESSION' or
a `.data EXPRESSION' statement.  When generating COFF output, you can
also use an extra subsection argument with arbitrary named sections:
`.section NAME, EXPRESSION'.  When generating ELF output, you can also
use the `.subsection' directive (*note SubSection::) to specify a
subsection: `.subsection EXPRESSION'.  EXPRESSION should be an absolute
expression (*note Expressions::).  If you just say `.text' then `.text
0' is assumed.  Likewise `.data' means `.data 0'.  Assembly begins in
`text 0'.  For instance:
     .text 0     # The default subsection is text 0 anyway.
     .ascii "This lives in the first text subsection. *"
     .text 1
     .ascii "But this lives in the second text subsection."
     .data 0
     .ascii "This lives in the data section,"
     .ascii "in the first data subsection."
     .text 0
     .ascii "This lives in the first text section,"
     .ascii "immediately following the asterisk (*)."

   Each section has a "location counter" incremented by one for every
byte assembled into that section.  Because subsections are merely a
convenience restricted to `as' there is no concept of a subsection
location counter.  There is no way to directly manipulate a location
counter--but the `.align' directive changes it, and any label
definition captures its current value.  The location counter of the
section where statements are being assembled is said to be the "active"
location counter.

4.5 bss Section
===============

The bss section is used for local common variable storage.  You may
allocate address space in the bss section, but you may not dictate data
to load into it before your program executes.  When your program starts
running, all the contents of the bss section are zeroed bytes.

   The `.lcomm' pseudo-op defines a symbol in the bss section; see
*Note `.lcomm': Lcomm.

   The `.comm' pseudo-op may be used to declare a common symbol, which
is another form of uninitialized symbol; see *Note `.comm': Comm.

   When assembling for a target which supports multiple sections, such
as ELF or COFF, you may switch into the `.bss' section and define
symbols as usual; see *Note `.section': Section.  You may only assemble
zero values into the section.  Typically the section will only contain
symbol definitions and `.skip' directives (*note `.skip': Skip.).

*********

Symbols are a central concept: the programmer uses symbols to name
things, the linker uses symbols to link, and the debugger uses symbols
to debug.

     _Warning:_ `as' does not place symbols in the object file in the
     same order they were declared.  This may break some debuggers.

5.1 Labels
==========

A "label" is written as a symbol immediately followed by a colon `:'.
The symbol then represents the current value of the active location
counter, and is, for example, a suitable instruction operand.  You are
warned if you use the same symbol to represent two different locations:
the first definition overrides any other definitions.

   On the HPPA, the usual form for a label need not be immediately
followed by a colon, but instead must start in column zero.  Only one
label may be defined on a single line.  To work around this, the HPPA
version of `as' also provides a special directive `.label' for defining
labels more flexibly.

5.2 Giving Symbols Other Values
===============================

A symbol can be given an arbitrary value by writing a symbol, followed
by an equals sign `=', followed by an expression (*note Expressions::).
This is equivalent to using the `.set' directive.  *Note `.set': Set.
In the same way, using a double equals sign `='`=' here represents an
equivalent of the `.eqv' directive.  *Note `.eqv': Eqv.

   Blackfin does not support symbol assignment with `='.

5.3 Symbol Names
================

Symbol names begin with a letter or with one of `._'.  On most
machines, you can also use `$' in symbol names; exceptions are noted in
*Note Machine Dependencies::.  That character may be followed by any
string of digits, letters, dollar signs (unless otherwise noted for a
particular target machine), and underscores.

Case of letters is significant: `foo' is a different symbol name than
`Foo'.

   Symbol names do not start with a digit.  An exception to this rule
is made for Local Labels.  See below.

   Multibyte characters are supported.  To generate a symbol name
containing multibyte characters enclose it within double quotes and use
escape codes. cf *Note Strings::.  Generating a multibyte symbol name
from a label is not currently supported.

   Each symbol has exactly one name.  Each name in an assembly language
program refers to exactly one symbol.  You may use that symbol name any
number of times in a program.

Local Symbol Names
------------------

A local symbol is any symbol beginning with certain local label
prefixes.  By default, the local label prefix is `.L' for ELF systems or
`L' for traditional a.out systems, but each target may have its own set
of local label prefixes.  On the HPPA local symbols begin with `L$'.

   Local symbols are defined and used within the assembler, but they are
normally not saved in object files.  Thus, they are not visible when
debugging.  You may use the `-L' option (*note Include Local Symbols:
L.)  to retain the local symbols in the object files.

Local Labels
------------

Local labels are different from local symbols.  Local labels help
compilers and programmers use names temporarily.  They create symbols
which are guaranteed to be unique over the entire scope of the input
source code and which can be referred to by a simple notation.  To
define a local label, write a label of the form `N:' (where N
represents any non-negative integer).  To refer to the most recent
previous definition of that label write `Nb', using the same number as
when you defined the label.  To refer to the next definition of a local
label, write `Nf'.  The `b' stands for "backwards" and the `f' stands
for "forwards".

   There is no restriction on how you can use these labels, and you can
reuse them too.  So that it is possible to repeatedly define the same
local label (using the same number `N'), although you can only refer to
the most recently defined local label of that number (for a backwards
reference) or the next definition of a specific local label for a
forward reference.  It is also worth noting that the first 10 local
labels (`0:'...`9:') are implemented in a slightly more efficient
manner than the others.

   Here is an example:

     1:        branch 1f
     2:        branch 1b
     1:        branch 2f
     2:        branch 1b

   Which is the equivalent of:

     label_1:  branch label_3
     label_2:  branch label_1
     label_3:  branch label_4
     label_4:  branch label_3

   Local label names are only a notational device.  They are immediately
transformed into more conventional symbol names before the assembler
uses them.  The symbol names are stored in the symbol table, appear in
error messages, and are optionally emitted to the object file.  The
names are constructed using these parts:

`_local label prefix_'
     All local symbols begin with the system-specific local label
     prefix.  Normally both `as' and `ld' forget symbols that start
     with the local label prefix.  These labels are used for symbols
     you are never intended to see.  If you use the `-L' option then
     `as' retains these symbols in the object file. If you also
     instruct `ld' to retain these symbols, you may use them in
     debugging.

`NUMBER'
     This is the number that was used in the local label definition.
     So if the label is written `55:' then the number is `55'.

`C-B'
     This unusual character is included so you do not accidentally
     invent a symbol of the same name.  The character has ASCII value
     of `\002' (control-B).

`_ordinal number_'
     This is a serial number to keep the labels distinct.  The first
     definition of `0:' gets the number `1'.  The 15th definition of
     `0:' gets the number `15', and so on.  Likewise the first
     definition of `1:' gets the number `1' and its 15th definition
     gets `15' as well.

   So for example, the first `1:' may be named `.L1C-B1', and the 44th
`3:' may be named `.L3C-B44'.

Dollar Local Labels
-------------------

On some targets `as' also supports an even more local form of local
labels called dollar labels.  These labels go out of scope (i.e., they
become undefined) as soon as a non-local label is defined.  Thus they
remain valid for only a small region of the input source code.  Normal
local labels, by contrast, remain in scope for the entire file, or
until they are redefined by another occurrence of the same local label.

   Dollar labels are defined in exactly the same way as ordinary local
labels, except that they have a dollar sign suffix to their numeric
value, e.g., `55$:'.

   They can also be distinguished from ordinary local labels by their
transformed names which use ASCII character `\001' (control-A) as the
magic character to distinguish them from ordinary labels.  For example,
the fifth definition of `6$' may be named `.L6C-A5'.

5.4 The Special Dot Symbol
==========================

The special symbol `.' refers to the current address that `as' is
assembling into.  Thus, the expression `melvin: .long .' defines
`melvin' to contain its own address.  Assigning a value to `.' is
treated the same as a `.org' directive.  Thus, the expression `.=.+4'
is the same as saying `.space 4'.


File: as.info,  Node: Symbol Attributes,  Prev: Dot,  Up: Symbols

5.5 Symbol Attributes
=====================

Every symbol has, as well as its name, the attributes "Value" and
"Type".  Depending on output format, symbols can also have auxiliary
attributes.

   If you use a symbol without defining it, `as' assumes zero for all
these attributes, and probably won't warn you.  This makes the symbol
an externally defined symbol, which is generally what you would want.

File: as.info,  Node: Symbol Value,  Next: Symbol Type,  Up: Symbol Attributes

5.5.1 Value
-----------

The value of a symbol is (usually) 32 bits.  For a symbol which labels a
location in the text, data, bss or absolute sections the value is the
number of addresses from the start of that section to the label.
Naturally for text, data and bss sections the value of a symbol changes
as `ld' changes section base addresses during linking.  Absolute
symbols' values do not change during linking: that is why they are
called absolute.

   The value of an undefined symbol is treated in a special way.  If it
is 0 then the symbol is not defined in this assembler source file, and
`ld' tries to determine its value from other files linked into the same
program.  You make this kind of symbol simply by mentioning a symbol
name without defining it.  A non-zero value represents a `.comm' common
declaration.  The value is how much common storage to reserve, in bytes
(addresses).  The symbol refers to the first address of the allocated
storage.

5.5.2 Type
----------

The type attribute of a symbol contains relocation (section)
information, any flag settings indicating that a symbol is external, and
(optionally), other information for linkers and debuggers.  The exact
format depends on the object-code output format in use.

6 Expressions
*************

An "expression" specifies an address or numeric value.  Whitespace may
precede and/or follow an expression.

   The result of an expression must be an absolute number, or else an
offset into a particular section.  If an expression is not absolute,
and there is not enough information when `as' sees the expression to
know its section, a second pass over the source program might be
necessary to interpret the expression--but the second pass is currently
not implemented.  `as' aborts with an error message in this situation.

6.1 Empty Expressions
=====================

An empty expression has no value: it is just whitespace or null.
Wherever an absolute expression is required, you may omit the
expression, and `as' assumes a value of (absolute) 0.  This is
compatible with other assemblers.

An "integer expression" is one or more _arguments_ delimited by
_operators_.

File: as.info,  Node: Arguments,  Next: Operators,  Up: Integer Exprs

6.2.1 Arguments
---------------

"Arguments" are symbols, numbers or subexpressions.  In other contexts
arguments are sometimes called "arithmetic operands".  In this manual,
to avoid confusing them with the "instruction operands" of the machine
language, we use the term "argument" to refer to parts of expressions
only, reserving the word "operand" to refer only to machine instruction
operands.

   Symbols are evaluated to yield {SECTION NNN} where SECTION is one of
text, data, bss, absolute, or undefined.  NNN is a signed, 2's
complement 32 bit integer.

   Numbers are usually integers.

   A number can be a flonum or bignum.  In this case, you are warned
that only the low order 32 bits are used, and `as' pretends these 32
bits are an integer.  You may write integer-manipulating instructions
that act on exotic constants, compatible with other assemblers.

   Subexpressions are a left parenthesis `(' followed by an integer
expression, followed by a right parenthesis `)'; or a prefix operator
followed by an argument.


File: as.info,  Node: Operators,  Next: Prefix Ops,  Prev: Arguments,  Up: Integer Exprs

6.2.2 Operators
---------------

"Operators" are arithmetic functions, like `+' or `%'.  Prefix
operators are followed by an argument.  Infix operators appear between
their arguments.  Operators may be preceded and/or followed by
whitespace.


File: as.info,  Node: Prefix Ops,  Next: Infix Ops,  Prev: Operators,  Up: Integer Exprs

6.2.3 Prefix Operator
---------------------

`as' has the following "prefix operators".  They each take one
argument, which must be absolute.

`-'
     "Negation".  Two's complement negation.

`~'
     "Complementation".  Bitwise not.


File: as.info,  Node: Infix Ops,  Prev: Prefix Ops,  Up: Integer Exprs

6.2.4 Infix Operators
---------------------

"Infix operators" take two arguments, one on either side.  Operators
have precedence, but operations with equal precedence are performed left
to right.  Apart from `+' or `-', both arguments must be absolute, and
the result is absolute.

  1. Highest Precedence

    `*'
          "Multiplication".

    `/'
          "Division".  Truncation is the same as the C operator `/'

    `%'
          "Remainder".

    `<<'
          "Shift Left".  Same as the C operator `<<'.

    `>>'
          "Shift Right".  Same as the C operator `>>'.

  2. Intermediate precedence

    `|'
          "Bitwise Inclusive Or".

    `&'
          "Bitwise And".

    `^'
          "Bitwise Exclusive Or".

    `!'
          "Bitwise Or Not".

  3. Low Precedence

    `+'
          "Addition".  If either argument is absolute, the result has
          the section of the other argument.  You may not add together
          arguments from different sections.

    `-'
          "Subtraction".  If the right argument is absolute, the result
          has the section of the left argument.  If both arguments are
          in the same section, the result is absolute.  You may not
          subtract arguments from different sections.

    `=='
          "Is Equal To"

    `<>'
    `!='
          "Is Not Equal To"

    `<'
          "Is Less Than"

    `>'
          "Is Greater Than"

    `>='
          "Is Greater Than Or Equal To"

    `<='
          "Is Less Than Or Equal To"

          The comparison operators can be used as infix operators.  A
          true results has a value of -1 whereas a false result has a
          value of 0.   Note, these operators perform signed
          comparisons.

  4. Lowest Precedence

    `&&'
          "Logical And".

    `||'
          "Logical Or".

          These two logical operations can be used to combine the
          results of sub expressions.  Note, unlike the comparison
          operators a true result returns a value of 1 but a false
          results does still return 0.  Also note that the logical or
          operator has a slightly lower precedence than logical and.


   In short, it's only meaningful to add or subtract the _offsets_ in an
address; you can only have a defined section in one of the two
arguments.

7.1 `.abort'
============

This directive stops the assembly immediately.  It is for compatibility
with other assemblers.  The original idea was that the assembly
language source would be piped into the assembler.  If the sender of
the source quit, it could use this directive tells `as' to quit also.
One day `.abort' will not be supported.

7.2 `.ABORT' (COFF)
===================

When producing COFF output, `as' accepts this directive as a synonym
for `.abort'.


File: as.info,  Node: Align,  Next: Altmacro,  Prev: ABORT (COFF),  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.3 `.align ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR'
=========================================

Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment required, as described below.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require
skipping more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is
not done at all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument)
entirely by simply using two commas after the required alignment; this
can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op
instructions when appropriate.

   The way the required alignment is specified varies from system to
system.  For the arc, hppa, i386 using ELF, i860, iq2000, m68k, or1k,
s390, sparc, tic4x, tic80 and xtensa, the first expression is the
alignment request in bytes.  For example `.align 8' advances the
location counter until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.  For the tic54x, the
first expression is the alignment request in words.

   For other systems, including ppc, i386 using a.out format, arm and
strongarm, it is the number of low-order zero bits the location counter
must have after advancement.  For example `.align 3' advances the
location counter until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is
already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   This inconsistency is due to the different behaviors of the various
native assemblers for these systems which GAS must emulate.  GAS also
provides `.balign' and `.p2align' directives, described later, which
have a consistent behavior across all architectures (but are specific
to GAS).

7.4 `.altmacro'
===============

Enable alternate macro mode, enabling:

`LOCAL NAME [ , ... ]'
     One additional directive, `LOCAL', is available.  It is used to
     generate a string replacement for each of the NAME arguments, and
     replace any instances of NAME in each macro expansion.  The
     replacement string is unique in the assembly, and different for
     each separate macro expansion.  `LOCAL' allows you to write macros
     that define symbols, without fear of conflict between separate
     macro expansions.

`String delimiters'
     You can write strings delimited in these other ways besides
     `"STRING"':

    `'STRING''
          You can delimit strings with single-quote characters.

    `<STRING>'
          You can delimit strings with matching angle brackets.

`single-character string escape'
     To include any single character literally in a string (even if the
     character would otherwise have some special meaning), you can
     prefix the character with `!' (an exclamation mark).  For example,
     you can write `<4.3 !> 5.4!!>' to get the literal text `4.3 >
     5.4!'.

`Expression results as strings'
     You can write `%EXPR' to evaluate the expression EXPR and use the
     result as a string.

`.asciz' is just like `.ascii', but each string is followed by a zero
byte.  The "z" in `.asciz' stands for "zero".


File: as.info,  Node: Balign,  Next: Bundle directives,  Prev: Asciz,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.7 `.balign[wl] ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR'
==============================================

Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment request in bytes.  For example `.balign 8' advances the
location counter until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require
skipping more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is
not done at all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument)
entirely by simply using two commas after the required alignment; this
can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op
instructions when appropriate.

   The `.balignw' and `.balignl' directives are variants of the
`.balign' directive.  The `.balignw' directive treats the fill pattern
as a two byte word value.  The `.balignl' directives treats the fill
pattern as a four byte longword value.  For example, `.balignw
4,0x368d' will align to a multiple of 4.  If it skips two bytes, they
will be filled in with the value 0x368d (the exact placement of the
bytes depends upon the endianness of the processor).  If it skips 1 or
3 bytes, the fill value is undefined.


File: as.info,  Node: Bundle directives,  Next: Byte,  Prev: Balign,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.8 Bundle directives
=====================

7.8.1 `.bundle_align_mode ABS-EXPR'
-----------------------------------

`.bundle_align_mode' enables or disables "aligned instruction bundle"
mode.  In this mode, sequences of adjacent instructions are grouped
into fixed-sized "bundles".  If the argument is zero, this mode is
disabled (which is the default state).  If the argument it not zero, it
gives the size of an instruction bundle as a power of two (as for the
`.p2align' directive, *note P2align::).

   For some targets, it's an ABI requirement that no instruction may
span a certain aligned boundary.  A "bundle" is simply a sequence of
instructions that starts on an aligned boundary.  For example, if
ABS-EXPR is `5' then the bundle size is 32, so each aligned chunk of 32
bytes is a bundle.  When aligned instruction bundle mode is in effect,
no single instruction may span a boundary between bundles.  If an
instruction would start too close to the end of a bundle for the length
of that particular instruction to fit within the bundle, then the space
at the end of that bundle is filled with no-op instructions so the
instruction starts in the next bundle.  As a corollary, it's an error
if any single instruction's encoding is longer than the bundle size.

7.8.2 `.bundle_lock' and `.bundle_unlock'
-----------------------------------------

The `.bundle_lock' and directive `.bundle_unlock' directives allow
explicit control over instruction bundle padding.  These directives are
only valid when `.bundle_align_mode' has been used to enable aligned
instruction bundle mode.  It's an error if they appear when
`.bundle_align_mode' has not been used at all, or when the last
directive was `.bundle_align_mode 0'.

   For some targets, it's an ABI requirement that certain instructions
may appear only as part of specified permissible sequences of multiple
instructions, all within the same bundle.  A pair of `.bundle_lock' and
`.bundle_unlock' directives define a "bundle-locked" instruction
sequence.  For purposes of aligned instruction bundle mode, a sequence
starting with `.bundle_lock' and ending with `.bundle_unlock' is
treated as a single instruction.  That is, the entire sequence must fit
into a single bundle and may not span a bundle boundary.  If necessary,
no-op instructions will be inserted before the first instruction of the
sequence so that the whole sequence starts on an aligned bundle
boundary.  It's an error if the sequence is longer than the bundle size.

   For convenience when using `.bundle_lock' and `.bundle_unlock'
inside assembler macros (*note Macro::), bundle-locked sequences may be
nested.  That is, a second `.bundle_lock' directive before the next
`.bundle_unlock' directive has no effect except that it must be matched
by another closing `.bundle_unlock' so that there is the same number of
`.bundle_lock' and `.bundle_unlock' directives.


File: as.info,  Node: Byte,  Next: CFI directives,  Prev: Bundle directives,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.9 `.byte EXPRESSIONS'
=======================

`.byte' expects zero or more expressions, separated by commas.  Each
expression is assembled into the next byte.


File: as.info,  Node: CFI directives,  Next: Comm,  Prev: Byte,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.10 CFI directives
===================

7.10.1 `.cfi_sections SECTION_LIST'
-----------------------------------

`.cfi_sections' may be used to specify whether CFI directives should
emit `.eh_frame' section and/or `.debug_frame' section.  If
SECTION_LIST is `.eh_frame', `.eh_frame' is emitted, if SECTION_LIST is
`.debug_frame', `.debug_frame' is emitted.  To emit both use
`.eh_frame, .debug_frame'.  The default if this directive is not used
is `.cfi_sections .eh_frame'.

   On targets that support compact unwinding tables these can be
generated by specifying `.eh_frame_entry' instead of `.eh_frame'.

   Some targets may support an additional name, such as `.c6xabi.exidx'
which is used by the  target.

   The `.cfi_sections' directive can be repeated, with the same or
different arguments, provided that CFI generation has not yet started.
Once CFI generation has started however the section list is fixed and
any attempts to redefine it will result in an error.

7.10.2 `.cfi_startproc [simple]'
--------------------------------

`.cfi_startproc' is used at the beginning of each function that should
have an entry in `.eh_frame'. It initializes some internal data
structures. Don't forget to close the function by `.cfi_endproc'.

   Unless `.cfi_startproc' is used along with parameter `simple' it
also emits some architecture dependent initial CFI instructions.

7.10.3 `.cfi_endproc'
---------------------

`.cfi_endproc' is used at the end of a function where it closes its
unwind entry previously opened by `.cfi_startproc', and emits it to
`.eh_frame'.

7.10.4 `.cfi_personality ENCODING [, EXP]'
------------------------------------------

`.cfi_personality' defines personality routine and its encoding.
ENCODING must be a constant determining how the personality should be
encoded.  If it is 255 (`DW_EH_PE_omit'), second argument is not
present, otherwise second argument should be a constant or a symbol
name.  When using indirect encodings, the symbol provided should be the
location where personality can be loaded from, not the personality
routine itself.  The default after `.cfi_startproc' is
`.cfi_personality 0xff', no personality routine.

7.10.5 `.cfi_personality_id ID'
-------------------------------

`cfi_personality_id' defines a personality routine by its index as
defined in a compact unwinding format.  Only valid when generating
compact EH frames (i.e.  with `.cfi_sections eh_frame_entry'.

7.10.6 `.cfi_fde_data [OPCODE1 [, ...]]'
----------------------------------------

`cfi_fde_data' is used to describe the compact unwind opcodes to be
used for the current function.  These are emitted inline in the
`.eh_frame_entry' section if small enough and there is no LSDA, or in
the `.gnu.extab' section otherwise.  Only valid when generating compact
EH frames (i.e.  with `.cfi_sections eh_frame_entry'.

7.10.7 `.cfi_lsda ENCODING [, EXP]'
-----------------------------------

`.cfi_lsda' defines LSDA and its encoding.  ENCODING must be a constant
determining how the LSDA should be encoded.  If it is 255
(`DW_EH_PE_omit'), the second argument is not present, otherwise the
second argument should be a constant or a symbol name.  The default
after `.cfi_startproc' is `.cfi_lsda 0xff', meaning that no LSDA is
present.

7.10.8 `.cfi_inline_lsda' [ALIGN]
---------------------------------

`.cfi_inline_lsda' marks the start of a LSDA data section and switches
to the corresponding `.gnu.extab' section.  Must be preceded by a CFI
block containing a `.cfi_lsda' directive.  Only valid when generating
compact EH frames (i.e.  with `.cfi_sections eh_frame_entry'.

   The table header and unwinding opcodes will be generated at this
point, so that they are immediately followed by the LSDA data.  The
symbol referenced by the `.cfi_lsda' directive should still be defined
in case a fallback FDE based encoding is used.  The LSDA data is
terminated by a section directive.

   The optional ALIGN argument specifies the alignment required.  The
alignment is specified as a power of two, as with the `.p2align'
directive.

7.10.9 `.cfi_def_cfa REGISTER, OFFSET'
--------------------------------------

`.cfi_def_cfa' defines a rule for computing CFA as: take address from
REGISTER and add OFFSET to it.

7.10.10 `.cfi_def_cfa_register REGISTER'
----------------------------------------

`.cfi_def_cfa_register' modifies a rule for computing CFA. From now on
REGISTER will be used instead of the old one. Offset remains the same.

7.10.11 `.cfi_def_cfa_offset OFFSET'
------------------------------------

`.cfi_def_cfa_offset' modifies a rule for computing CFA. Register
remains the same, but OFFSET is new. Note that it is the absolute
offset that will be added to a defined register to compute CFA address.

7.10.12 `.cfi_adjust_cfa_offset OFFSET'
---------------------------------------

Same as `.cfi_def_cfa_offset' but OFFSET is a relative value that is
added/subtracted from the previous offset.

7.10.13 `.cfi_offset REGISTER, OFFSET'
--------------------------------------

Previous value of REGISTER is saved at offset OFFSET from CFA.

7.10.14 `.cfi_val_offset REGISTER, OFFSET'
------------------------------------------

Previous value of REGISTER is CFA + OFFSET.

7.10.15 `.cfi_rel_offset REGISTER, OFFSET'
------------------------------------------

Previous value of REGISTER is saved at offset OFFSET from the current
CFA register.  This is transformed to `.cfi_offset' using the known
displacement of the CFA register from the CFA.  This is often easier to
use, because the number will match the code it's annotating.

7.10.16 `.cfi_register REGISTER1, REGISTER2'
--------------------------------------------

Previous value of REGISTER1 is saved in register REGISTER2.

7.10.17 `.cfi_restore REGISTER'
-------------------------------

`.cfi_restore' says that the rule for REGISTER is now the same as it
was at the beginning of the function, after all initial instruction
added by `.cfi_startproc' were executed.

7.10.18 `.cfi_undefined REGISTER'
---------------------------------

From now on the previous value of REGISTER can't be restored anymore.

7.10.19 `.cfi_same_value REGISTER'
----------------------------------

Current value of REGISTER is the same like in the previous frame, i.e.
no restoration needed.

7.10.20 `.cfi_remember_state' and `.cfi_restore_state'
------------------------------------------------------

`.cfi_remember_state' pushes the set of rules for every register onto an
implicit stack, while `.cfi_restore_state' pops them off the stack and
places them in the current row.  This is useful for situations where
you have multiple `.cfi_*' directives that need to be undone due to the
control flow of the program.  For example, we could have something like
this (assuming the CFA is the value of `rbp'):

             je label
             popq %rbx
             .cfi_restore %rbx
             popq %r12
             .cfi_restore %r12
             popq %rbp
             .cfi_restore %rbp
             .cfi_def_cfa %rsp, 8
             ret
     label:
             /* Do something else */

   Here, we want the `.cfi' directives to affect only the rows
corresponding to the instructions before `label'.  This means we'd have
to add multiple `.cfi' directives after `label' to recreate the
original save locations of the registers, as well as setting the CFA
back to the value of `rbp'.  This would be clumsy, and result in a
larger binary size. Instead, we can write:

             je label
             popq %rbx
             .cfi_remember_state
             .cfi_restore %rbx
             popq %r12
             .cfi_restore %r12
             popq %rbp
             .cfi_restore %rbp
             .cfi_def_cfa %rsp, 8
             ret
     label:
             .cfi_restore_state
             /* Do something else */

   That way, the rules for the instructions after `label' will be the
same as before the first `.cfi_restore' without having to use multiple
`.cfi' directives.

7.10.21 `.cfi_return_column REGISTER'
-------------------------------------

Change return column REGISTER, i.e. the return address is either
directly in REGISTER or can be accessed by rules for REGISTER.

7.10.22 `.cfi_signal_frame'
---------------------------

Mark current function as signal trampoline.

7.10.23 `.cfi_window_save'
--------------------------

SPARC register window has been saved.

7.10.24 `.cfi_escape' EXPRESSION[, ...]
---------------------------------------

Allows the user to add arbitrary bytes to the unwind info.  One might
use this to add OS-specific CFI opcodes, or generic CFI opcodes that
GAS does not yet support.

7.10.25 `.cfi_val_encoded_addr REGISTER, ENCODING, LABEL'
---------------------------------------------------------

The current value of REGISTER is LABEL.  The value of LABEL will be
encoded in the output file according to ENCODING; see the description
of `.cfi_personality' for details on this encoding.

   The usefulness of equating a register to a fixed label is probably
limited to the return address register.  Here, it can be useful to mark
a code segment that has only one return address which is reached by a
direct branch and no copy of the return address exists in memory or
another register.


File: as.info,  Node: Comm,  Next: Data,  Prev: CFI directives,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.11 `.comm SYMBOL , LENGTH '
=============================

`.comm' declares a common symbol named SYMBOL.  When linking, a common
symbol in one object file may be merged with a defined or common symbol
of the same name in another object file.  If `ld' does not see a
definition for the symbol-just one or more common symbols-then it will
allocate LENGTH bytes of uninitialized memory.  LENGTH must be an
absolute expression.  If `ld' sees multiple common symbols with the
same name, and they do not all have the same size, it will allocate
space using the largest size.

   When using ELF or (as a GNU extension) PE, the `.comm' directive
takes an optional third argument.  This is the desired alignment of the
symbol, specified for ELF as a byte boundary (for example, an alignment
of 16 means that the least significant 4 bits of the address should be
zero), and for PE as a power of two (for example, an alignment of 5
means aligned to a 32-byte boundary).  The alignment must be an
absolute expression, and it must be a power of two.  If `ld' allocates
uninitialized memory for the common symbol, it will use the alignment
when placing the symbol.  If no alignment is specified, `as' will set
the alignment to the largest power of two less than or equal to the
size of the symbol, up to a maximum of 16 on ELF, or the default
section alignment of 4 on PE(1).

   The syntax for `.comm' differs slightly on the HPPA.  The syntax is
`SYMBOL .comm, LENGTH'; SYMBOL is optional.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is not the same as the executable image file alignment
controlled by `ld''s `--section-alignment' option; image file sections
in PE are aligned to multiples of 4096, which is far too large an
alignment for ordinary variables.  It is rather the default alignment
for (non-debug) sections within object (`*.o') files, which are less
strictly aligned.

7.12 `.data SUBSECTION'

7.25 `.equiv SYMBOL, EXPRESSION'
================================

The `.equiv' directive is like `.equ' and `.set', except that the
assembler will signal an error if SYMBOL is already defined.  Note a
symbol which has been referenced but not actually defined is considered
to be undefined.

   Except for the contents of the error message, this is roughly
equivalent to
     .ifdef SYM
     .err
     .endif
     .equ SYM,VAL
   plus it protects the symbol from later redefinition.


File: as.info,  Node: Eqv,  Next: Err,  Prev: Equiv,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.26 `.eqv SYMBOL, EXPRESSION'
==============================

The `.eqv' directive is like `.equiv', but no attempt is made to
evaluate the expression or any part of it immediately.  Instead each
time the resulting symbol is used in an expression, a snapshot of its
current value is taken.


File: as.info,  Node: Err,  Next: Error,  Prev: Eqv,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.27 `.err'
===========

If `as' assembles a `.err' directive, it will print an error message
and, unless the `-Z' option was used, it will not generate an object
file.  This can be used to signal an error in conditionally compiled
code.


File: as.info,  Node: Error,  Next: Exitm,  Prev: Err,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.28 `.error "STRING"'
======================

Similarly to `.err', this directive emits an error, but you can specify
a string that will be emitted as the error message.  If you don't
specify the message, it defaults to `".error directive invoked in
source file"'.  *Note Error and Warning Messages: Errors.

      .error "This code has not been assembled and tested."


File: as.info,  Node: Exitm,  Next: Extern,  Prev: Error,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.29 `.exitm'
=============

Exit early from the current macro definition.  *Note Macro::.


File: as.info,  Node: Extern,  Next: Fail,  Prev: Exitm,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.30 `.extern'
==============

`.extern' is accepted in the source program--for compatibility with
other assemblers--but it is ignored.  `as' treats all undefined symbols
as external.


File: as.info,  Node: Fail,  Next: File,  Prev: Extern,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.31 `.fail EXPRESSION'
=======================

Generates an error or a warning.  If the value of the EXPRESSION is 500
or more, `as' will print a warning message.  If the value is less than
500, `as' will print an error message.  The message will include the
value of EXPRESSION.  This can occasionally be useful inside complex
nested macros or conditional assembly.


File: as.info,  Node: File,  Next: Fill,  Prev: Fail,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.32 `.file'
============

There are two different versions of the `.file' directive.  Targets
that support DWARF2 line number information use the DWARF2 version of
`.file'.  Other targets use the default version.

Default Version
---------------

This version of the `.file' directive tells `as' that we are about to
start a new logical file.  The syntax is:

     .file STRING

   STRING is the new file name.  In general, the filename is recognized
whether or not it is surrounded by quotes `"'; but if you wish to
specify an empty file name, you must give the quotes-`""'.  This
statement may go away in future: it is only recognized to be compatible
with old `as' programs.

DWARF2 Version
--------------

When emitting DWARF2 line number information, `.file' assigns filenames
to the `.debug_line' file name table.  The syntax is:

     .file FILENO FILENAME

   The FILENO operand should be a unique positive integer to use as the
index of the entry in the table.  The FILENAME operand is a C string
literal.

   The detail of filename indices is exposed to the user because the
filename table is shared with the `.debug_info' section of the DWARF2
debugging information, and thus the user must know the exact indices
that table entries will have.


File: as.info,  Node: Fill,  Next: Float,  Prev: File,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.33 `.fill REPEAT , SIZE , VALUE'
==================================

REPEAT, SIZE and VALUE are absolute expressions.  This emits REPEAT
copies of SIZE bytes.  REPEAT may be zero or more.  SIZE may be zero or
more, but if it is more than 8, then it is deemed to have the value 8,
compatible with other people's assemblers.  The contents of each REPEAT
bytes is taken from an 8-byte number.  The highest order 4 bytes are
zero.  The lowest order 4 bytes are VALUE rendered in the byte-order of
an integer on the computer `as' is assembling for.  Each SIZE bytes in
a repetition is taken from the lowest order SIZE bytes of this number.
Again, this bizarre behavior is compatible with other people's
assemblers.

   SIZE and VALUE are optional.  If the second comma and VALUE are
absent, VALUE is assumed zero.  If the first comma and following tokens
are absent, SIZE is assumed to be 1.


File: as.info,  Node: Float,  Next: Func,  Prev: Fill,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.34 `.float FLONUMS'
=====================

This directive assembles zero or more flonums, separated by commas.  It
has the same effect as `.single'.  The exact kind of floating point
numbers emitted depends on how `as' is configured.  *Note Machine
Dependencies::.


File: as.info,  Node: Func,  Next: Global,  Prev: Float,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.35 `.func NAME[,LABEL]'
=========================

`.func' emits debugging information to denote function NAME, and is
ignored unless the file is assembled with debugging enabled.  Only
`--gstabs[+]' is currently supported.  LABEL is the entry point of the
function and if omitted NAME prepended with the `leading char' is used.
`leading char' is usually `_' or nothing, depending on the target.  All
functions are currently defined to have `void' return type.  The
function must be terminated with `.endfunc'.


File: as.info,  Node: Global,  Next: Gnu_attribute,  Prev: Func,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.36 `.global SYMBOL', `.globl SYMBOL'
======================================

`.global' makes the symbol visible to `ld'.  If you define SYMBOL in
your partial program, its value is made available to other partial
programs that are linked with it.  Otherwise, SYMBOL takes its
attributes from a symbol of the same name from another file linked into
the same program.

   Both spellings (`.globl' and `.global') are accepted, for
compatibility with other assemblers.

   On the HPPA, `.global' is not always enough to make it accessible to
other partial programs.  You may need the HPPA-only `.EXPORT' directive
as well.  *Note HPPA Assembler Directives: HPPA Directives.


File: as.info,  Node: Gnu_attribute,  Next: Hidden,  Prev: Global,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.37 `.gnu_attribute TAG,VALUE'
===============================

Record a GNU object attribute for this file.  *Note Object Attributes::.


File: as.info,  Node: Hidden,  Next: hword,  Prev: Gnu_attribute,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.38 `.hidden NAMES'
====================

This is one of the ELF visibility directives.  The other two are
`.internal' (*note `.internal': Internal.) and `.protected' (*note
`.protected': Protected.).

   This directive overrides the named symbols default visibility (which
is set by their binding: local, global or weak).  The directive sets
the visibility to `hidden' which means that the symbols are not visible
to other components.  Such symbols are always considered to be
`protected' as well.


File: as.info,  Node: hword,  Next: Ident,  Prev: Hidden,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.39 `.hword EXPRESSIONS'
=========================

This expects zero or more EXPRESSIONS, and emits a 16 bit number for
each.

   This directive is a synonym for `.short'; depending on the target
architecture, it may also be a synonym for `.word'.


File: as.info,  Node: Ident,  Next: If,  Prev: hword,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.40 `.ident'
=============

This directive is used by some assemblers to place tags in object
files.  The behavior of this directive varies depending on the target.
When using the a.out object file format, `as' simply accepts the
directive for source-file compatibility with existing assemblers, but
does not emit anything for it.  When using COFF, comments are emitted
to the `.comment' or `.rdata' section, depending on the target.  When
using ELF, comments are emitted to the `.comment' section.


File: as.info,  Node: If,  Next: Incbin,  Prev: Ident,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.41 `.if ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
==============================

`.if' marks the beginning of a section of code which is only considered
part of the source program being assembled if the argument (which must
be an ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION) is non-zero.  The end of the conditional
section of code must be marked by `.endif' (*note `.endif': Endif.);
optionally, you may include code for the alternative condition, flagged
by `.else' (*note `.else': Else.).  If you have several conditions to
check, `.elseif' may be used to avoid nesting blocks if/else within
each subsequent `.else' block.

   The following variants of `.if' are also supported:
`.ifdef SYMBOL'
     Assembles the following section of code if the specified SYMBOL
     has been defined.  Note a symbol which has been referenced but not
     yet defined is considered to be undefined.

`.ifb TEXT'
     Assembles the following section of code if the operand is blank
     (empty).

`.ifc STRING1,STRING2'
     Assembles the following section of code if the two strings are the
     same.  The strings may be optionally quoted with single quotes.
     If they are not quoted, the first string stops at the first comma,
     and the second string stops at the end of the line.  Strings which
     contain whitespace should be quoted.  The string comparison is
     case sensitive.

`.ifeq ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is zero.

`.ifeqs STRING1,STRING2'
     Another form of `.ifc'.  The strings must be quoted using double
     quotes.

`.ifge ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is greater
     than or equal to zero.

`.ifgt ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is greater
     than zero.

`.ifle ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is less
     than or equal to zero.

`.iflt ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is less
     than zero.

`.ifnb TEXT'
     Like `.ifb', but the sense of the test is reversed: this assembles
     the following section of code if the operand is non-blank
     (non-empty).

`.ifnc STRING1,STRING2.'
     Like `.ifc', but the sense of the test is reversed: this assembles
     the following section of code if the two strings are not the same.

`.ifndef SYMBOL'
`.ifnotdef SYMBOL'
     Assembles the following section of code if the specified SYMBOL
     has not been defined.  Both spelling variants are equivalent.
     Note a symbol which has been referenced but not yet defined is
     considered to be undefined.

`.ifne ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is not
     equal to zero (in other words, this is equivalent to `.if').

`.ifnes STRING1,STRING2'
     Like `.ifeqs', but the sense of the test is reversed: this
     assembles the following section of code if the two strings are not
     the same.


File: as.info,  Node: Incbin,  Next: Include,  Prev: If,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.42 `.incbin "FILE"[,SKIP[,COUNT]]'
====================================

The `incbin' directive includes FILE verbatim at the current location.
You can control the search paths used with the `-I' command-line option
(*note Command-Line Options: Invoking.).  Quotation marks are required
around FILE.

   The SKIP argument skips a number of bytes from the start of the
FILE.  The COUNT argument indicates the maximum number of bytes to
read.  Note that the data is not aligned in any way, so it is the user's
responsibility to make sure that proper alignment is provided both
before and after the `incbin' directive.


File: as.info,  Node: Include,  Next: Int,  Prev: Incbin,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.43 `.include "FILE"'
======================

This directive provides a way to include supporting files at specified
points in your source program.  The code from FILE is assembled as if
it followed the point of the `.include'; when the end of the included
file is reached, assembly of the original file continues.  You can
control the search paths used with the `-I' command-line option (*note
Command-Line Options: Invoking.).  Quotation marks are required around
FILE.


File: as.info,  Node: Int,  Next: Internal,  Prev: Include,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.44 `.int EXPRESSIONS'
=======================

Expect zero or more EXPRESSIONS, of any section, separated by commas.
For each expression, emit a number that, at run time, is the value of
that expression.  The byte order and bit size of the number depends on
what kind of target the assembly is for.


File: as.info,  Node: Internal,  Next: Irp,  Prev: Int,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.45 `.internal NAMES'
======================

This is one of the ELF visibility directives.  The other two are
`.hidden' (*note `.hidden': Hidden.) and `.protected' (*note
`.protected': Protected.).

   This directive overrides the named symbols default visibility (which
is set by their binding: local, global or weak).  The directive sets
the visibility to `internal' which means that the symbols are
considered to be `hidden' (i.e., not visible to other components), and
that some extra, processor specific processing must also be performed
upon the  symbols as well.


File: as.info,  Node: Irp,  Next: Irpc,  Prev: Internal,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.46 `.irp SYMBOL,VALUES'...
============================

Evaluate a sequence of statements assigning different values to SYMBOL.
The sequence of statements starts at the `.irp' directive, and is
terminated by an `.endr' directive.  For each VALUE, SYMBOL is set to
VALUE, and the sequence of statements is assembled.  If no VALUE is
listed, the sequence of statements is assembled once, with SYMBOL set
to the null string.  To refer to SYMBOL within the sequence of
statements, use \SYMBOL.

   For example, assembling

             .irp    param,1,2,3
             move    d\param,sp@-
             .endr

   is equivalent to assembling

             move    d1,sp@-
             move    d2,sp@-
             move    d3,sp@-

   For some caveats with the spelling of SYMBOL, see also *Note Macro::.


File: as.info,  Node: Irpc,  Next: Lcomm,  Prev: Irp,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.47 `.irpc SYMBOL,VALUES'...
=============================

Evaluate a sequence of statements assigning different values to SYMBOL.
The sequence of statements starts at the `.irpc' directive, and is
terminated by an `.endr' directive.  For each character in VALUE,
SYMBOL is set to the character, and the sequence of statements is
assembled.  If no VALUE is listed, the sequence of statements is
assembled once, with SYMBOL set to the null string.  To refer to SYMBOL
within the sequence of statements, use \SYMBOL.

   For example, assembling

             .irpc    param,123
             move    d\param,sp@-
             .endr

   is equivalent to assembling

             move    d1,sp@-
             move    d2,sp@-
             move    d3,sp@-

   For some caveats with the spelling of SYMBOL, see also the discussion
at *Note Macro::.


File: as.info,  Node: Lcomm,  Next: Lflags,  Prev: Irpc,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.48 `.lcomm SYMBOL , LENGTH'
=============================

Reserve LENGTH (an absolute expression) bytes for a local common
denoted by SYMBOL.  The section and value of SYMBOL are those of the
new local common.  The addresses are allocated in the bss section, so
that at run-time the bytes start off zeroed.  SYMBOL is not declared
global (*note `.global': Global.), so is normally not visible to `ld'.

   Some targets permit a third argument to be used with `.lcomm'.  This
argument specifies the desired alignment of the symbol in the bss
section.

   The syntax for `.lcomm' differs slightly on the HPPA.  The syntax is
`SYMBOL .lcomm, LENGTH'; SYMBOL is optional.


File: as.info,  Node: Lflags,  Next: Line,  Prev: Lcomm,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.49 `.lflags'
==============

`as' accepts this directive, for compatibility with other assemblers,
but ignores it.


File: as.info,  Node: Line,  Next: Linkonce,  Prev: Lflags,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.50 `.line LINE-NUMBER'
========================

Change the logical line number.  LINE-NUMBER must be an absolute
expression.  The next line has that logical line number.  Therefore any
other statements on the current line (after a statement separator
character) are reported as on logical line number LINE-NUMBER - 1.  One
day `as' will no longer support this directive: it is recognized only
for compatibility with existing assembler programs.

Even though this is a directive associated with the `a.out' or `b.out'
object-code formats, `as' still recognizes it when producing COFF
output, and treats `.line' as though it were the COFF `.ln' _if_ it is
found outside a `.def'/`.endef' pair.

   Inside a `.def', `.line' is, instead, one of the directives used by
compilers to generate auxiliary symbol information for debugging.


File: as.info,  Node: Linkonce,  Next: List,  Prev: Line,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.51 `.linkonce [TYPE]'
=======================

Mark the current section so that the linker only includes a single copy
of it.  This may be used to include the same section in several
different object files, but ensure that the linker will only include it
once in the final output file.  The `.linkonce' pseudo-op must be used
for each instance of the section.  Duplicate sections are detected
based on the section name, so it should be unique.

   This directive is only supported by a few object file formats; as of
this writing, the only object file format which supports it is the
Portable Executable format used on Windows NT.

   The TYPE argument is optional.  If specified, it must be one of the
following strings.  For example:
     .linkonce same_size
   Not all types may be supported on all object file formats.

`discard'
     Silently discard duplicate sections.  This is the default.

`one_only'
     Warn if there are duplicate sections, but still keep only one copy.

`same_size'
     Warn if any of the duplicates have different sizes.

`same_contents'
     Warn if any of the duplicates do not have exactly the same
     contents.


File: as.info,  Node: List,  Next: Ln,  Prev: Linkonce,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.52 `.list'
============

Control (in conjunction with the `.nolist' directive) whether or not
assembly listings are generated.  These two directives maintain an
internal counter (which is zero initially).   `.list' increments the
counter, and `.nolist' decrements it.  Assembly listings are generated
whenever the counter is greater than zero.

   By default, listings are disabled.  When you enable them (with the
`-a' command line option; *note Command-Line Options: Invoking.), the
initial value of the listing counter is one.


File: as.info,  Node: Ln,  Next: Loc,  Prev: List,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.53 `.ln LINE-NUMBER'
======================

`.ln' is a synonym for `.line'.


File: as.info,  Node: Loc,  Next: Loc_mark_labels,  Prev: Ln,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.54 `.loc FILENO LINENO [COLUMN] [OPTIONS]'
============================================

When emitting DWARF2 line number information, the `.loc' directive will
add a row to the `.debug_line' line number matrix corresponding to the
immediately following assembly instruction.  The FILENO, LINENO, and
optional COLUMN arguments will be applied to the `.debug_line' state
machine before the row is added.

   The OPTIONS are a sequence of the following tokens in any order:

`basic_block'
     This option will set the `basic_block' register in the
     `.debug_line' state machine to `true'.

`prologue_end'
     This option will set the `prologue_end' register in the
     `.debug_line' state machine to `true'.

`epilogue_begin'
     This option will set the `epilogue_begin' register in the
     `.debug_line' state machine to `true'.

`is_stmt VALUE'
     This option will set the `is_stmt' register in the `.debug_line'
     state machine to `value', which must be either 0 or 1.

`isa VALUE'
     This directive will set the `isa' register in the `.debug_line'
     state machine to VALUE, which must be an unsigned integer.

`discriminator VALUE'
     This directive will set the `discriminator' register in the
     `.debug_line' state machine to VALUE, which must be an unsigned
     integer.



File: as.info,  Node: Loc_mark_labels,  Next: Local,  Prev: Loc,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.55 `.loc_mark_labels ENABLE'
==============================

When emitting DWARF2 line number information, the `.loc_mark_labels'
directive makes the assembler emit an entry to the `.debug_line' line
number matrix with the `basic_block' register in the state machine set
whenever a code label is seen.  The ENABLE argument should be either 1
or 0, to enable or disable this function respectively.


File: as.info,  Node: Local,  Next: Long,  Prev: Loc_mark_labels,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.56 `.local NAMES'
===================

This directive, which is available for ELF targets, marks each symbol in
the comma-separated list of `names' as a local symbol so that it will
not be externally visible.  If the symbols do not already exist, they
will be created.

   For targets where the `.lcomm' directive (*note Lcomm::) does not
accept an alignment argument, which is the case for most ELF targets,
the `.local' directive can be used in combination with `.comm' (*note
Comm::) to define aligned local common data.


File: as.info,  Node: Long,  Next: Macro,  Prev: Local,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.57 `.long EXPRESSIONS'
========================

`.long' is the same as `.int'.  *Note `.int': Int.


File: as.info,  Node: Macro,  Next: MRI,  Prev: Long,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.58 `.macro'
=============

The commands `.macro' and `.endm' allow you to define macros that
generate assembly output.  For example, this definition specifies a
macro `sum' that puts a sequence of numbers into memory:

             .macro  sum from=0, to=5
             .long   \from
             .if     \to-\from
             sum     "(\from+1)",\to
             .endif
             .endm

With that definition, `SUM 0,5' is equivalent to this assembly input:

             .long   0
             .long   1
             .long   2
             .long   3
             .long   4
             .long   5

`.macro MACNAME'
`.macro MACNAME MACARGS ...'
     Begin the definition of a macro called MACNAME.  If your macro
     definition requires arguments, specify their names after the macro
     name, separated by commas or spaces.  You can qualify the macro
     argument to indicate whether all invocations must specify a
     non-blank value (through `:`req''), or whether it takes all of the
     remaining arguments (through `:`vararg'').  You can supply a
     default value for any macro argument by following the name with
     `=DEFLT'.  You cannot define two macros with the same MACNAME
     unless it has been subject to the `.purgem' directive (*note
     Purgem::) between the two definitions.  For example, these are all
     valid `.macro' statements:

    `.macro comm'
          Begin the definition of a macro called `comm', which takes no
          arguments.

    `.macro plus1 p, p1'
    `.macro plus1 p p1'
          Either statement begins the definition of a macro called
          `plus1', which takes two arguments; within the macro
          definition, write `\p' or `\p1' to evaluate the arguments.

    `.macro reserve_str p1=0 p2'
          Begin the definition of a macro called `reserve_str', with two
          arguments.  The first argument has a default value, but not
          the second.  After the definition is complete, you can call
          the macro either as `reserve_str A,B' (with `\p1' evaluating
          to A and `\p2' evaluating to B), or as `reserve_str ,B' (with
          `\p1' evaluating as the default, in this case `0', and `\p2'
          evaluating to B).

    `.macro m p1:req, p2=0, p3:vararg'
          Begin the definition of a macro called `m', with at least
          three arguments.  The first argument must always have a value
          specified, but not the second, which instead has a default
          value. The third formal will get assigned all remaining
          arguments specified at invocation time.

          When you call a macro, you can specify the argument values
          either by position, or by keyword.  For example, `sum 9,17'
          is equivalent to `sum to=17, from=9'.


     Note that since each of the MACARGS can be an identifier exactly
     as any other one permitted by the target architecture, there may be
     occasional problems if the target hand-crafts special meanings to
     certain characters when they occur in a special position.  For
     example, if the colon (`:') is generally permitted to be part of a
     symbol name, but the architecture specific code special-cases it
     when occurring as the final character of a symbol (to denote a
     label), then the macro parameter replacement code will have no way
     of knowing that and consider the whole construct (including the
     colon) an identifier, and check only this identifier for being the
     subject to parameter substitution.  So for example this macro
     definition:

          	.macro label l
          \l:
          	.endm

     might not work as expected.  Invoking `label foo' might not create
     a label called `foo' but instead just insert the text `\l:' into
     the assembler source, probably generating an error about an
     unrecognised identifier.

     Similarly problems might occur with the period character (`.')
     which is often allowed inside opcode names (and hence identifier
     names).  So for example constructing a macro to build an opcode
     from a base name and a length specifier like this:

          	.macro opcode base length
                  \base.\length
          	.endm

     and invoking it as `opcode store l' will not create a `store.l'
     instruction but instead generate some kind of error as the
     assembler tries to interpret the text `\base.\length'.

     There are several possible ways around this problem:

    `Insert white space'
          If it is possible to use white space characters then this is
          the simplest solution.  eg:

               	.macro label l
               \l :
               	.endm

    `Use `\()''
          The string `\()' can be used to separate the end of a macro
          argument from the following text.  eg:

               	.macro opcode base length
                       \base\().\length
               	.endm

    `Use the alternate macro syntax mode'
          In the alternative macro syntax mode the ampersand character
          (`&') can be used as a separator.  eg:

               	.altmacro
               	.macro label l
               l&:
               	.endm

     Note: this problem of correctly identifying string parameters to
     pseudo ops also applies to the identifiers used in `.irp' (*note
     Irp::) and `.irpc' (*note Irpc::) as well.

`.endm'
     Mark the end of a macro definition.

`.exitm'
     Exit early from the current macro definition.

`\@'
     `as' maintains a counter of how many macros it has executed in
     this pseudo-variable; you can copy that number to your output with
     `\@', but _only within a macro definition_.

`LOCAL NAME [ , ... ]'
     _Warning: `LOCAL' is only available if you select "alternate macro
     syntax" with `--alternate' or `.altmacro'._ *Note `.altmacro':
     Altmacro.

7.59 `.mri VAL'
===============

If VAL is non-zero, this tells `as' to enter MRI mode.  If VAL is zero,
this tells `as' to exit MRI mode.  This change affects code assembled
until the next `.mri' directive, or until the end of the file.  *Note
MRI mode: M.

==================

Disable alternate macro mode.  *Note Altmacro::.


File: as.info,  Node: Nolist,  Next: Octa,  Prev: Noaltmacro,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.61 `.nolist'
==============

Control (in conjunction with the `.list' directive) whether or not
assembly listings are generated.  These two directives maintain an
internal counter (which is zero initially).   `.list' increments the
counter, and `.nolist' decrements it.  Assembly listings are generated
whenever the counter is greater than zero.


File: as.info,  Node: Octa,  Next: Offset,  Prev: Nolist,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.62 `.octa BIGNUMS'
====================

This directive expects zero or more bignums, separated by commas.  For
each bignum, it emits a 16-byte integer.

   The term "octa" comes from contexts in which a "word" is two bytes;
hence _octa_-word for 16 bytes.


File: as.info,  Node: Offset,  Next: Org,  Prev: Octa,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.63 `.offset LOC'
==================

Set the location counter to LOC in the absolute section.  LOC must be
an absolute expression.  This directive may be useful for defining
symbols with absolute values.  Do not confuse it with the `.org'
directive.


File: as.info,  Node: Org,  Next: P2align,  Prev: Offset,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.64 `.org NEW-LC , FILL'
=========================

Advance the location counter of the current section to NEW-LC.  NEW-LC
is either an absolute expression or an expression with the same section
as the current subsection.  That is, you can't use `.org' to cross
sections: if NEW-LC has the wrong section, the `.org' directive is
ignored.  To be compatible with former assemblers, if the section of
NEW-LC is absolute, `as' issues a warning, then pretends the section of
NEW-LC is the same as the current subsection.

   `.org' may only increase the location counter, or leave it
unchanged; you cannot use `.org' to move the location counter backwards.

   Because `as' tries to assemble programs in one pass, NEW-LC may not
be undefined.  If you really detest this restriction we eagerly await a
chance to share your improved assembler.

   Beware that the origin is relative to the start of the section, not
to the start of the subsection.  This is compatible with other people's
assemblers.

   When the location counter (of the current subsection) is advanced,
the intervening bytes are filled with FILL which should be an absolute
expression.  If the comma and FILL are omitted, FILL defaults to zero.


File: as.info,  Node: P2align,  Next: PopSection,  Prev: Org,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.65 `.p2align[wl] ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR'
================================================

Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
number of low-order zero bits the location counter must have after
advancement.  For example `.p2align 3' advances the location counter
until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a
multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require
skipping more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is
not done at all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument)
entirely by simply using two commas after the required alignment; this
can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op
instructions when appropriate.

   The `.p2alignw' and `.p2alignl' directives are variants of the
`.p2align' directive.  The `.p2alignw' directive treats the fill
pattern as a two byte word value.  The `.p2alignl' directives treats the
fill pattern as a four byte longword value.  For example, `.p2alignw
2,0x368d' will align to a multiple of 4.  If it skips two bytes, they
will be filled in with the value 0x368d (the exact placement of the
bytes depends upon the endianness of the processor).  If it skips 1 or
3 bytes, the fill value is undefined.

7.66 `.popsection'
==================

This is one of the ELF section stack manipulation directives.  The
others are `.section' (*note Section::), `.subsection' (*note
SubSection::), `.pushsection' (*note PushSection::), and `.previous'
(*note Previous::).

   This directive replaces the current section (and subsection) with
the top section (and subsection) on the section stack.  This section is
popped off the stack.


File: as.info,  Node: Previous,  Next: Print,  Prev: PopSection,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.67 `.previous'
================

This is one of the ELF section stack manipulation directives.  The
others are `.section' (*note Section::), `.subsection' (*note
SubSection::), `.pushsection' (*note PushSection::), and `.popsection'
(*note PopSection::).

   This directive swaps the current section (and subsection) with most
recently referenced section/subsection pair prior to this one.  Multiple
`.previous' directives in a row will flip between two sections (and
their subsections).  For example:

     .section A
      .subsection 1
       .word 0x1234
      .subsection 2
       .word 0x5678
     .previous
      .word 0x9abc

   Will place 0x1234 and 0x9abc into subsection 1 and 0x5678 into
subsection 2 of section A.  Whilst:

     .section A
     .subsection 1
       # Now in section A subsection 1
       .word 0x1234
     .section B
     .subsection 0
       # Now in section B subsection 0
       .word 0x5678
     .subsection 1
       # Now in section B subsection 1
       .word 0x9abc
     .previous
       # Now in section B subsection 0
       .word 0xdef0

   Will place 0x1234 into section A, 0x5678 and 0xdef0 into subsection
0 of section B and 0x9abc into subsection 1 of section B.

   In terms of the section stack, this directive swaps the current
section with the top section on the section stack.

7.68 `.print STRING'
====================

`as' will print STRING on the standard output during assembly.  You
must put STRING in double quotes.


File: as.info,  Node: Protected,  Next: Psize,  Prev: Print,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.69 `.protected NAMES'
=======================

This is one of the ELF visibility directives.  The other two are
`.hidden' (*note Hidden::) and `.internal' (*note Internal::).

   This directive overrides the named symbols default visibility (which
is set by their binding: local, global or weak).  The directive sets
the visibility to `protected' which means that any references to the
symbols from within the components that defines them must be resolved
to the definition in that component, even if a definition in another
component would normally preempt this.


File: as.info,  Node: Psize,  Next: Purgem,  Prev: Protected,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.70 `.psize LINES , COLUMNS'
=============================

Use this directive to declare the number of lines--and, optionally, the
number of columns--to use for each page, when generating listings.

   If you do not use `.psize', listings use a default line-count of 60.
You may omit the comma and COLUMNS specification; the default width is
200 columns.

   `as' generates formfeeds whenever the specified number of lines is
exceeded (or whenever you explicitly request one, using `.eject').

   If you specify LINES as `0', no formfeeds are generated save those
explicitly specified with `.eject'.


File: as.info,  Node: Purgem,  Next: PushSection,  Prev: Psize,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.71 `.purgem NAME'
===================

Undefine the macro NAME, so that later uses of the string will not be
expanded.  *Note Macro::.


File: as.info,  Node: PushSection,  Next: Quad,  Prev: Purgem,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.72 `.pushsection NAME [, SUBSECTION] [, "FLAGS"[, @TYPE[,ARGUMENTS]]]'
========================================================================

This is one of the ELF section stack manipulation directives.  The
others are `.section' (*note Section::), `.subsection' (*note
SubSection::), `.popsection' (*note PopSection::), and `.previous'
(*note Previous::).

   This directive pushes the current section (and subsection) onto the
top of the section stack, and then replaces the current section and
subsection with `name' and `subsection'. The optional `flags', `type'
and `arguments' are treated the same as in the `.section' (*note
Section::) directive.


File: as.info,  Node: Quad,  Next: Reloc,  Prev: PushSection,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.73 `.quad BIGNUMS'
====================

`.quad' expects zero or more bignums, separated by commas.  For each
bignum, it emits an 8-byte integer.  If the bignum won't fit in 8
bytes, it prints a warning message; and just takes the lowest order 8
bytes of the bignum.  

   The term "quad" comes from contexts in which a "word" is two bytes;
hence _quad_-word for 8 bytes.


File: as.info,  Node: Reloc,  Next: Rept,  Prev: Quad,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.74 `.reloc OFFSET, RELOC_NAME[, EXPRESSION]'
==============================================

Generate a relocation at OFFSET of type RELOC_NAME with value
EXPRESSION.  If OFFSET is a number, the relocation is generated in the
current section.  If OFFSET is an expression that resolves to a symbol
plus offset, the relocation is generated in the given symbol's section.
EXPRESSION, if present, must resolve to a symbol plus addend or to an
absolute value, but note that not all targets support an addend.  e.g.
ELF REL targets such as i386 store an addend in the section contents
rather than in the relocation.  This low level interface does not
support addends stored in the section.


File: as.info,  Node: Rept,  Next: Sbttl,  Prev: Reloc,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.75 `.rept COUNT'
==================

Repeat the sequence of lines between the `.rept' directive and the next
`.endr' directive COUNT times.

   For example, assembling

             .rept   3
             .long   0
             .endr

   is equivalent to assembling

             .long   0
             .long   0
             .long   0


File: as.info,  Node: Sbttl,  Next: Scl,  Prev: Rept,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.76 `.sbttl "SUBHEADING"'
==========================

Use SUBHEADING as the title (third line, immediately after the title
line) when generating assembly listings.

   This directive affects subsequent pages, as well as the current page
if it appears within ten lines of the top of a page.


File: as.info,  Node: Scl,  Next: Section,  Prev: Sbttl,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.77 `.scl CLASS'
=================

Set the storage-class value for a symbol.  This directive may only be
used inside a `.def'/`.endef' pair.  Storage class may flag whether a
symbol is static or external, or it may record further symbolic
debugging information.


File: as.info,  Node: Section,  Next: Set,  Prev: Scl,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.78 `.section NAME'
====================

Use the `.section' directive to assemble the following code into a
section named NAME.

   This directive is only supported for targets that actually support
arbitrarily named sections; on `a.out' targets, for example, it is not
accepted, even with a standard `a.out' section name.

COFF Version
------------

   For COFF targets, the `.section' directive is used in one of the
following ways:

     .section NAME[, "FLAGS"]
     .section NAME[, SUBSECTION]

   If the optional argument is quoted, it is taken as flags to use for
the section.  Each flag is a single character.  The following flags are
recognized:

`b'
     bss section (uninitialized data)

`n'
     section is not loaded

`w'
     writable section

`d'
     data section

`e'
     exclude section from linking

`r'
     read-only section

`x'
     executable section

`s'
     shared section (meaningful for PE targets)

`a'
     ignored.  (For compatibility with the ELF version)

`y'
     section is not readable (meaningful for PE targets)

`0-9'
     single-digit power-of-two section alignment (GNU extension)

   If no flags are specified, the default flags depend upon the section
name.  If the section name is not recognized, the default will be for
the section to be loaded and writable.  Note the `n' and `w' flags
remove attributes from the section, rather than adding them, so if they
are used on their own it will be as if no flags had been specified at
all.

   If the optional argument to the `.section' directive is not quoted,
it is taken as a subsection number (*note Sub-Sections::).

ELF Version
-----------

   This is one of the ELF section stack manipulation directives.  The
others are `.subsection' (*note SubSection::), `.pushsection' (*note
PushSection::), `.popsection' (*note PopSection::), and `.previous'
(*note Previous::).

   For ELF targets, the `.section' directive is used like this:

     .section NAME [, "FLAGS"[, @TYPE[,FLAG_SPECIFIC_ARGUMENTS]]]

   If the `--sectname-subst' command-line option is provided, the NAME
argument may contain a substitution sequence. Only `%S' is supported at
the moment, and substitutes the current section name. For example:

     .macro exception_code
     .section %S.exception
     [exception code here]
     .previous
     .endm

     .text
     [code]
     exception_code
     [...]

     .section .init
     [init code]
     exception_code
     [...]

   The two `exception_code' invocations above would create the
`.text.exception' and `.init.exception' sections respectively.  This is
useful e.g. to discriminate between ancillary sections that are tied to
setup code to be discarded after use from ancillary sections that need
to stay resident without having to define multiple `exception_code'
macros just for that purpose.

   The optional FLAGS argument is a quoted string which may contain any
combination of the following characters:

`a'
     section is allocatable

`d'
     section is a GNU_MBIND section

`e'
     section is excluded from executable and shared library.

`w'
     section is writable

`x'
     section is executable

`M'
     section is mergeable

`S'
     section contains zero terminated strings

`G'
     section is a member of a section group

`T'
     section is used for thread-local-storage

`?'
     section is a member of the previously-current section's group, if
     any

``<number>''
     a numeric value indicating the bits to be set in the ELF section
     header's flags field.  Note - if one or more of the alphabetic
     characters described above is also included in the flags field,
     their bit values will be ORed into the resulting value.

``<target specific>''
     some targets extend this list with their own flag characters

   Note - once a section's flags have been set they cannot be changed.
There are a few exceptions to this rule however.  Processor and
application specific flags can be added to an already defined section.
The `.interp', `.strtab' and `.symtab' sections can have the allocate
flag (`a') set after they are initially defined, and the
`.note-GNU-stack' section may have the executable (`x') flag added.

   The optional TYPE argument may contain one of the following
constants:

`@progbits'
     section contains data

`@nobits'
     section does not contain data (i.e., section only occupies space)

`@note'
     section contains data which is used by things other than the
     program

`@init_array'
     section contains an array of pointers to init functions

`@fini_array'
     section contains an array of pointers to finish functions

`@preinit_array'
     section contains an array of pointers to pre-init functions

`@`<number>''
     a numeric value to be set as the ELF section header's type field.

`@`<target specific>''
     some targets extend this list with their own types

   Many targets only support the first three section types.  The type
may be enclosed in double quotes if necessary.

   Note on targets where the `@' character is the start of a comment (eg
ARM) then another character is used instead.  For example the ARM port
uses the `%' character.

   Note - some sections, eg `.text' and `.data' are considered to be
special and have fixed types.  Any attempt to declare them with a
different type will generate an error from the assembler.

   If FLAGS contains the `M' symbol then the TYPE argument must be
specified as well as an extra argument--ENTSIZE--like this:

     .section NAME , "FLAGS"M, @TYPE, ENTSIZE

   Sections with the `M' flag but not `S' flag must contain fixed size
constants, each ENTSIZE octets long. Sections with both `M' and `S'
must contain zero terminated strings where each character is ENTSIZE
bytes long. The linker may remove duplicates within sections with the
same name, same entity size and same flags.  ENTSIZE must be an
absolute expression.  For sections with both `M' and `S', a string
which is a suffix of a larger string is considered a duplicate.  Thus
`"def"' will be merged with `"abcdef"';  A reference to the first
`"def"' will be changed to a reference to `"abcdef"+3'.

   If FLAGS contains the `G' symbol then the TYPE argument must be
present along with an additional field like this:

     .section NAME , "FLAGS"G, @TYPE, GROUPNAME[, LINKAGE]

   The GROUPNAME field specifies the name of the section group to which
this particular section belongs.  The optional linkage field can
contain:

`comdat'
     indicates that only one copy of this section should be retained

`.gnu.linkonce'
     an alias for comdat

   Note: if both the M and G flags are present then the fields for the
Merge flag should come first, like this:

     .section NAME , "FLAGS"MG, @TYPE, ENTSIZE, GROUPNAME[, LINKAGE]

   If FLAGS contains the `?' symbol then it may not also contain the
`G' symbol and the GROUPNAME or LINKAGE fields should not be present.
Instead, `?' says to consider the section that's current before this
directive.  If that section used `G', then the new section will use `G'
with those same GROUPNAME and LINKAGE fields implicitly.  If not, then
the `?' symbol has no effect.

   If no flags are specified, the default flags depend upon the section
name.  If the section name is not recognized, the default will be for
the section to have none of the above flags: it will not be allocated
in memory, nor writable, nor executable.  The section will contain data.

   For ELF targets, the assembler supports another type of `.section'
directive for compatibility with the Solaris assembler:

     .section "NAME"[, FLAGS...]

   Note that the section name is quoted.  There may be a sequence of
comma separated flags:

`#alloc'
     section is allocatable

`#write'
     section is writable

`#execinstr'
     section is executable

`#exclude'
     section is excluded from executable and shared library.

`#tls'
     section is used for thread local storage

   This directive replaces the current section and subsection.  See the
contents of the gas testsuite directory `gas/testsuite/gas/elf' for
some examples of how this directive and the other section stack
directives work.


File: as.info,  Node: Set,  Next: Short,  Prev: Section,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.79 `.set SYMBOL, EXPRESSION'
==============================

Set the value of SYMBOL to EXPRESSION.  This changes SYMBOL's value and
type to conform to EXPRESSION.  If SYMBOL was flagged as external, it
remains flagged (*note Symbol Attributes::).

   You may `.set' a symbol many times in the same assembly provided
that the values given to the symbol are constants.  Values that are
based on expressions involving other symbols are allowed, but some
targets may restrict this to only being done once per assembly.  This
is because those targets do not set the addresses of symbols at
assembly time, but rather delay the assignment until a final link is
performed.  This allows the linker a chance to change the code in the
files, changing the location of, and the relative distance between,
various different symbols.

   If you `.set' a global symbol, the value stored in the object file
is the last value stored into it.

   On Z80 `set' is a real instruction, use `SYMBOL defl EXPRESSION'
instead.

7.81 `.single FLONUMS'
======================

7.82 `.size'
============

This directive is used to set the size associated with a symbol.

COFF Version
------------

   For COFF targets, the `.size' directive is only permitted inside
`.def'/`.endef' pairs.  It is used like this:

     .size EXPRESSION

ELF Version
-----------

   For ELF targets, the `.size' directive is used like this:

     .size NAME , EXPRESSION

   This directive sets the size associated with a symbol NAME.  The
size in bytes is computed from EXPRESSION which can make use of label
arithmetic.  This directive is typically used to set the size of
function symbols.

7.83 `.skip SIZE , FILL'

This directive emits SIZE bytes, each of value FILL.  Both SIZE and
FILL are absolute expressions.  If the comma and FILL are omitted, FILL
is assumed to be zero.  This is the same as `.space'.


File: as.info,  Node: Sleb128,  Next: Space,  Prev: Skip,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.84 `.sleb128 EXPRESSIONS'
===========================

SLEB128 stands for "signed little endian base 128."  This is a compact,

This directive emits SIZE bytes, each of value FILL.  Both SIZE and
FILL are absolute expressions.  If the comma and FILL are omitted, FILL
is assumed to be zero.  This is the same as `.skip'.

     _Warning:_ `.space' has a completely different meaning for HPPA
     targets; use `.block' as a substitute.  See `HP9000 Series 800
     Assembly Language Reference Manual' (HP 92432-90001) for the

7.86 `.stabd, .stabn, .stabs'
=============================

There are three directives that begin `.stab'.  All emit symbols (*note
Symbols::), for use by symbolic debuggers.  The symbols are not entered
in the `as' hash table: they cannot be referenced elsewhere in the
source file.  Up to five fields are required:

STRING
     This is the symbol's name.  It may contain any character except
     `\000', so is more general than ordinary symbol names.  Some
     debuggers used to code arbitrarily complex structures into symbol
     names using this field.

TYPE
     An absolute expression.  The symbol's type is set to the low 8
     bits of this expression.  Any bit pattern is permitted, but `ld'
     and debuggers choke on silly bit patterns.

OTHER
     An absolute expression.  The symbol's "other" attribute is set to
     the low 8 bits of this expression.

DESC
     An absolute expression.  The symbol's descriptor is set to the low
     16 bits of this expression.

VALUE
     An absolute expression which becomes the symbol's value.

   If a warning is detected while reading a `.stabd', `.stabn', or
`.stabs' statement, the symbol has probably already been created; you
get a half-formed symbol in your object file.  This is compatible with
earlier assemblers!

`.stabd TYPE , OTHER , DESC'
     The "name" of the symbol generated is not even an empty string.
     It is a null pointer, for compatibility.  Older assemblers used a
     null pointer so they didn't waste space in object files with empty
     strings.

     The symbol's value is set to the location counter, relocatably.
     When your program is linked, the value of this symbol is the
     address of the location counter when the `.stabd' was assembled.

`.stabn TYPE , OTHER , DESC , VALUE'
     The name of the symbol is set to the empty string `""'.

`.stabs STRING ,  TYPE , OTHER , DESC , VALUE'
     All five fields are specified.

7.87 `.string' "STR", `.string8' "STR", `.string16'
===================================================

"STR", `.string32' "STR", `.string64' "STR"

   Copy the characters in STR to the object file.  You may specify more
than one string to copy, separated by commas.  Unless otherwise
specified for a particular machine, the assembler marks the end of each
string with a 0 byte.  You can use any of the escape sequences
described in *Note Strings: Strings.

   The variants `string16', `string32' and `string64' differ from the
`string' pseudo opcode in that each 8-bit character from STR is copied
and expanded to 16, 32 or 64 bits respectively.  The expanded characters
are stored in target endianness byte order.

   Example:
     	.string32 "BYE"
     expands to:
     	.string   "B\0\0\0Y\0\0\0E\0\0\0"  /* On little endian targets.  */
     	.string   "\0\0\0B\0\0\0Y\0\0\0E"  /* On big endian targets.  */

7.88 `.struct EXPRESSION'
=========================

Switch to the absolute section, and set the section offset to
EXPRESSION, which must be an absolute expression.  You might use this
as follows:
             .struct 0
     field1:
             .struct field1 + 4
     field2:
             .struct field2 + 4
     field3:
   This would define the symbol `field1' to have the value 0, the symbol
`field2' to have the value 4, and the symbol `field3' to have the value
8.  Assembly would be left in the absolute section, and you would need
to use a `.section' directive of some sort to change to some other
section before further assembly.

7.89 `.subsection NAME'
=======================

This is one of the ELF section stack manipulation directives.  The
others are `.section' (*note Section::), `.pushsection' (*note
PushSection::), `.popsection' (*note PopSection::), and `.previous'
(*note Previous::).

   This directive replaces the current subsection with `name'.  The
current section is not changed.  The replaced subsection is put onto
the section stack in place of the then current top of stack subsection.


File: as.info,  Node: Symver,  Next: Tag,  Prev: SubSection,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.90 `.symver'
==============

Use the `.symver' directive to bind symbols to specific version nodes
within a source file.  This is only supported on ELF platforms, and is
typically used when assembling files to be linked into a shared library.
There are cases where it may make sense to use this in objects to be
bound into an application itself so as to override a versioned symbol
from a shared library.

   For ELF targets, the `.symver' directive can be used like this:
     .symver NAME, NAME2@NODENAME
   If the symbol NAME is defined within the file being assembled, the
`.symver' directive effectively creates a symbol alias with the name
NAME2@NODENAME, and in fact the main reason that we just don't try and
create a regular alias is that the @ character isn't permitted in
symbol names.  The NAME2 part of the name is the actual name of the
symbol by which it will be externally referenced.  The name NAME itself
is merely a name of convenience that is used so that it is possible to
have definitions for multiple versions of a function within a single
source file, and so that the compiler can unambiguously know which
version of a function is being mentioned.  The NODENAME portion of the
alias should be the name of a node specified in the version script
supplied to the linker when building a shared library.  If you are
attempting to override a versioned symbol from a shared library, then
NODENAME should correspond to the nodename of the symbol you are trying
to override.

   If the symbol NAME is not defined within the file being assembled,
all references to NAME will be changed to NAME2@NODENAME.  If no
reference to NAME is made, NAME2@NODENAME will be removed from the
symbol table.

   Another usage of the `.symver' directive is:
     .symver NAME, NAME2@@NODENAME
   In this case, the symbol NAME must exist and be defined within the
file being assembled. It is similar to NAME2@NODENAME. The difference
is NAME2@@NODENAME will also be used to resolve references to NAME2 by
the linker.

   The third usage of the `.symver' directive is:
     .symver NAME, NAME2@@@NODENAME
   When NAME is not defined within the file being assembled, it is
treated as NAME2@NODENAME. When NAME is defined within the file being
assembled, the symbol name, NAME, will be changed to NAME2@@NODENAME.

7.91 `.tag STRUCTNAME'
======================

This directive is generated by compilers to include auxiliary debugging
information in the symbol table.  It is only permitted inside
`.def'/`.endef' pairs.  Tags are used to link structure definitions in
the symbol table with instances of those structures.


File: as.info,  Node: Text,  Next: Title,  Prev: Tag,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.92 `.text SUBSECTION'
=======================

Tells `as' to assemble the following statements onto the end of the
text subsection numbered SUBSECTION, which is an absolute expression.
If SUBSECTION is omitted, subsection number zero is used.


File: as.info,  Node: Title,  Next: Type,  Prev: Text,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.93 `.title "HEADING"'
=======================

Use HEADING as the title (second line, immediately after the source
file name and pagenumber) when generating assembly listings.

   This directive affects subsequent pages, as well as the current page
if it appears within ten lines of the top of a page.


File: as.info,  Node: Type,  Next: Uleb128,  Prev: Title,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.94 `.type'
============

This directive is used to set the type of a symbol.

COFF Version
------------

   For COFF targets, this directive is permitted only within
`.def'/`.endef' pairs.  It is used like this:

     .type INT

   This records the integer INT as the type attribute of a symbol table
entry.

ELF Version
-----------

   For ELF targets, the `.type' directive is used like this:

     .type NAME , TYPE DESCRIPTION

   This sets the type of symbol NAME to be either a function symbol or
an object symbol.  There are five different syntaxes supported for the
TYPE DESCRIPTION field, in order to provide compatibility with various
other assemblers.

   Because some of the characters used in these syntaxes (such as `@'
and `#') are comment characters for some architectures, some of the
syntaxes below do not work on all architectures.  The first variant
will be accepted by the GNU assembler on all architectures so that
variant should be used for maximum portability, if you do not need to
assemble your code with other assemblers.

   The syntaxes supported are:

       .type <name> STT_<TYPE_IN_UPPER_CASE>
       .type <name>,#<type>
       .type <name>,@<type>
       .type <name>,%<type>
       .type <name>,"<type>"

   The types supported are:

`STT_FUNC'
`function'
     Mark the symbol as being a function name.

`STT_GNU_IFUNC'
`gnu_indirect_function'
     Mark the symbol as an indirect function when evaluated during reloc
     processing.  (This is only supported on assemblers targeting GNU
     systems).

`STT_OBJECT'
`object'
     Mark the symbol as being a data object.

`STT_TLS'
`tls_object'
     Mark the symbol as being a thread-local data object.

`STT_COMMON'
`common'
     Mark the symbol as being a common data object.

`STT_NOTYPE'
`notype'
     Does not mark the symbol in any way.  It is supported just for
     completeness.

`gnu_unique_object'
     Marks the symbol as being a globally unique data object.  The
     dynamic linker will make sure that in the entire process there is
     just one symbol with this name and type in use.  (This is only
     supported on assemblers targeting GNU systems).


   Note: Some targets support extra types in addition to those listed
above.

7.95 `.uleb128 EXPRESSIONS'
===========================

ULEB128 stands for "unsigned little endian base 128."  This is a
compact, variable length representation of numbers used by the DWARF
symbolic debugging format.  *Note `.sleb128': Sleb128.


File: as.info,  Node: Val,  Next: Version,  Prev: Uleb128,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.96 `.val ADDR'
================

This directive, permitted only within `.def'/`.endef' pairs, records
the address ADDR as the value attribute of a symbol table entry.


File: as.info,  Node: Version,  Next: VTableEntry,  Prev: Val,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.97 `.version "STRING"'
========================

This directive creates a `.note' section and places into it an ELF
formatted note of type NT_VERSION.  The note's name is set to `string'.


File: as.info,  Node: VTableEntry,  Next: VTableInherit,  Prev: Version,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.98 `.vtable_entry TABLE, OFFSET'
==================================

This directive finds or creates a symbol `table' and creates a
`VTABLE_ENTRY' relocation for it with an addend of `offset'.


File: as.info,  Node: VTableInherit,  Next: Warning,  Prev: VTableEntry,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.99 `.vtable_inherit CHILD, PARENT'
====================================

This directive finds the symbol `child' and finds or creates the symbol
`parent' and then creates a `VTABLE_INHERIT' relocation for the parent
whose addend is the value of the child symbol.  As a special case the
parent name of `0' is treated as referring to the `*ABS*' section.


File: as.info,  Node: Warning,  Next: Weak,  Prev: VTableInherit,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.100 `.warning "STRING"'
=========================

Similar to the directive `.error' (*note `.error "STRING"': Error.),
but just emits a warning.


File: as.info,  Node: Weak,  Next: Weakref,  Prev: Warning,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.101 `.weak NAMES'
===================

This directive sets the weak attribute on the comma separated list of
symbol `names'.  If the symbols do not already exist, they will be
created.

   On COFF targets other than PE, weak symbols are a GNU extension.
This directive sets the weak attribute on the comma separated list of
symbol `names'.  If the symbols do not already exist, they will be
created.

   On the PE target, weak symbols are supported natively as weak
aliases.  When a weak symbol is created that is not an alias, GAS
creates an alternate symbol to hold the default value.


File: as.info,  Node: Weakref,  Next: Word,  Prev: Weak,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.102 `.weakref ALIAS, TARGET'
==============================

This directive creates an alias to the target symbol that enables the
symbol to be referenced with weak-symbol semantics, but without
actually making it weak.  If direct references or definitions of the
symbol are present, then the symbol will not be weak, but if all
references to it are through weak references, the symbol will be marked
as weak in the symbol table.

   The effect is equivalent to moving all references to the alias to a
separate assembly source file, renaming the alias to the symbol in it,
declaring the symbol as weak there, and running a reloadable link to
merge the object files resulting from the assembly of the new source
file and the old source file that had the references to the alias
removed.

   The alias itself never makes to the symbol table, and is entirely
handled within the assembler.


File: as.info,  Node: Word,  Next: Zero,  Prev: Weakref,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.103 `.word EXPRESSIONS'
=========================

This directive expects zero or more EXPRESSIONS, of any section,
separated by commas.

   The size of the number emitted, and its byte order, depend on what
target computer the assembly is for.

     _Warning: Special Treatment to support Compilers_

   Machines with a 32-bit address space, but that do less than 32-bit
addressing, require the following special treatment.  If the machine of
interest to you does 32-bit addressing (or doesn't require it; *note
Machine Dependencies::), you can ignore this issue.

   In order to assemble compiler output into something that works, `as'
occasionally does strange things to `.word' directives.  Directives of
the form `.word sym1-sym2' are often emitted by compilers as part of
jump tables.  Therefore, when `as' assembles a directive of the form
`.word sym1-sym2', and the difference between `sym1' and `sym2' does
not fit in 16 bits, `as' creates a "secondary jump table", immediately
before the next label.  This secondary jump table is preceded by a
short-jump to the first byte after the secondary table.  This
short-jump prevents the flow of control from accidentally falling into
the new table.  Inside the table is a long-jump to `sym2'.  The
original `.word' contains `sym1' minus the address of the long-jump to
`sym2'.

   If there were several occurrences of `.word sym1-sym2' before the
secondary jump table, all of them are adjusted.  If there was a `.word
sym3-sym4', that also did not fit in sixteen bits, a long-jump to
`sym4' is included in the secondary jump table, and the `.word'
directives are adjusted to contain `sym3' minus the address of the
long-jump to `sym4'; and so on, for as many entries in the original
jump table as necessary.


File: as.info,  Node: Zero,  Next: 2byte,  Prev: Word,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.104 `.zero SIZE'
==================

This directive emits SIZE 0-valued bytes.  SIZE must be an absolute
expression.  This directive is actually an alias for the `.skip'
directive so in can take an optional second argument of the value to
store in the bytes instead of zero.  Using `.zero' in this way would be
confusing however.


File: as.info,  Node: 2byte,  Next: 4byte,  Prev: Zero,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.105 `.2byte EXPRESSION [, EXPRESSION]*'
=========================================

This directive expects zero or more expressions, separated by commas.
If there are no expressions then the directive does nothing.  Otherwise
each expression is evaluated in turn and placed in the next two bytes
of the current output section, using the endian model of the target.
If an expression will not fit in two bytes, a warning message is
displayed and the least significant two bytes of the expression's value
are used.  If an expression cannot be evaluated at assembly time then
relocations will be generated in order to compute the value at link
time.

   This directive does not apply any alignment before or after
inserting the values.  As a result of this, if relocations are
generated, they may be different from those used for inserting values
with a guaranteed alignment.

   This directive is only available for ELF targets,

long values into the output.

byte long bignum values into the output.

8 Object Attributes
*******************

`as' assembles source files written for a specific architecture into
object files for that architecture.  But not all object files are alike.
Many architectures support incompatible variations.  For instance,
floating point arguments might be passed in floating point registers if
the object file requires hardware floating point support--or floating
point arguments might be passed in integer registers if the object file
supports processors with no hardware floating point unit.  Or, if two
objects are built for different generations of the same architecture,
the combination may require the newer generation at run-time.

   This information is useful during and after linking.  At link time,
`ld' can warn about incompatible object files.  After link time, tools
like `gdb' can use it to process the linked file correctly.

   Compatibility information is recorded as a series of object
attributes.  Each attribute has a "vendor", "tag", and "value".  The
vendor is a string, and indicates who sets the meaning of the tag.  The
tag is an integer, and indicates what property the attribute describes.
The value may be a string or an integer, and indicates how the
property affects this object.  Missing attributes are the same as
attributes with a zero value or empty string value.

   Object attributes were developed as part of the ABI for the ARM
Architecture.  The file format is documented in `ELF for the ARM
Architecture'.

8.1 GNU Object Attributes
=========================

The `.gnu_attribute' directive records an object attribute with vendor
`gnu'.

   Except for `Tag_compatibility', which has both an integer and a
string for its value, GNU attributes have a string value if the tag
number is odd and an integer value if the tag number is even.  The
second bit (`TAG & 2' is set for architecture-independent attributes
and clear for architecture-dependent ones.

8.1.1 Common GNU attributes
---------------------------

These attributes are valid on all architectures.

Tag_compatibility (32)
     The compatibility attribute takes an integer flag value and a
     vendor name.  If the flag value is 0, the file is compatible with
     other toolchains.  If it is 1, then the file is only compatible
     with the named toolchain.  If it is greater than 1, the file can
     only be processed by other toolchains under some private
     arrangement indicated by the flag value and the vendor name.

8.1.2 MIPS Attributes
---------------------

Tag_GNU_MIPS_ABI_FP (4)
     The floating-point ABI used by this object file.  The value will
     be:

        * 0 for files not affected by the floating-point ABI.

        * 1 for files using the hardware floating-point ABI with a
          standard double-precision FPU.

        * 2 for files using the hardware floating-point ABI with a
          single-precision FPU.

        * 3 for files using the software floating-point ABI.

        * 4 for files using the deprecated hardware floating-point ABI
          which used 64-bit floating-point registers, 32-bit
          general-purpose registers and increased the number of
          callee-saved floating-point registers.

        * 5 for files using the hardware floating-point ABI with a
          double-precision FPU with either 32-bit or 64-bit
          floating-point registers and 32-bit general-purpose registers.

        * 6 for files using the hardware floating-point ABI with 64-bit
          floating-point registers and 32-bit general-purpose registers.

        * 7 for files using the hardware floating-point ABI with 64-bit
          floating-point registers, 32-bit general-purpose registers
          and a rule that forbids the direct use of odd-numbered
          single-precision floating-point registers.

8.1.3 PowerPC Attributes
------------------------

Tag_GNU_Power_ABI_FP (4)
     The floating-point ABI used by this object file.  The value will
     be:

        * 0 for files not affected by the floating-point ABI.

        * 1 for files using double-precision hardware floating-point
          ABI.

        * 2 for files using the software floating-point ABI.

        * 3 for files using single-precision hardware floating-point
          ABI.

Tag_GNU_Power_ABI_Vector (8)
     The vector ABI used by this object file.  The value will be:

        * 0 for files not affected by the vector ABI.

        * 1 for files using general purpose registers to pass vectors.

        * 2 for files using AltiVec registers to pass vectors.

        * 3 for files using SPE registers to pass vectors.

8.1.4 IBM z Systems Attributes
------------------------------

Tag_GNU_S390_ABI_Vector (8)
     The vector ABI used by this object file.  The value will be:

        * 0 for files not affected by the vector ABI.

        * 1 for files using software vector ABI.

        * 2 for files using hardware vector ABI.

8.2 Defining New Object Attributes
==================================

If you want to define a new GNU object attribute, here are the places
you will need to modify.  New attributes should be discussed on the
`binutils' mailing list.

   * This manual, which is the official register of attributes.

   * The header for your architecture `include/elf', to define the tag.

   * The `bfd' support file for your architecture, to merge the
     attribute and issue any appropriate link warnings.

   * Test cases in `ld/testsuite' for merging and link warnings.

   * `binutils/readelf.c' to display your attribute.

   * GCC, if you want the compiler to mark the attribute automatically.

9 Machine Dependent Features
****************************

The machine instruction sets are (almost by definition) different on
each machine where `as' runs.  Floating point representations vary as
well, and `as' often supports a few additional directives or
command-line options for compatibility with other assemblers on a
particular platform.  Finally, some versions of `as' support special
pseudo-instructions for branch optimization.

   This chapter discusses most of these differences, though it does not
include details on any machine's instruction set.  For details on that
subject, see the hardware manufacturer's manual.

9.1.1 Options
-------------

`-EB'
     This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler
     should be marked as being encoded for a big-endian processor.

`-EL'
     This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler
     should be marked as being encoded for a little-endian processor.

`-mabi=ABI'
     Specify which ABI the source code uses.  The recognized arguments
     are: `ilp32' and `lp64', which decides the generated object file
     in ELF32 and ELF64 format respectively.  The default is `lp64'.

`-mcpu=PROCESSOR[+EXTENSION...]'
     This option specifies the target processor.  The assembler will
     issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an
     instruction which will not execute on the target processor.  The
     following processor names are recognized: `cortex-a35',
     `cortex-a53', `cortex-a57', `cortex-a72', `cortex-a73',
     `exynos-m1', `falkor', `qdf24xx', `thunderx', `vulcan', `xgene1'
     and `xgene2'.  The special name `all' may be used to allow the
     assembler to accept instructions valid for any supported
     processor, including all optional extensions.

     In addition to the basic instruction set, the assembler can be
     told to accept, or restrict, various extension mnemonics that
     extend the processor.  *Note AArch64 Extensions::.

     If some implementations of a particular processor can have an
     extension, then then those extensions are automatically enabled.
     Consequently, you will not normally have to specify any additional
     extensions.

`-march=ARCHITECTURE[+EXTENSION...]'
     This option specifies the target architecture.  The assembler will
     issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an
     instruction which will not execute on the target architecture.  The
     following architecture names are recognized: `armv8-a',
     `armv8.1-a', `armv8.2-a' and `armv8.3-a'.

     If both `-mcpu' and `-march' are specified, the assembler will use
     the setting for `-mcpu'.  If neither are specified, the assembler
     will default to `-mcpu=all'.

     The architecture option can be extended with the same instruction
     set extension options as the `-mcpu' option.  Unlike `-mcpu',
     extensions are not always enabled by default, *Note AArch64
     Extensions::.

`-mverbose-error'
     This option enables verbose error messages for AArch64 gas.  This
     option is enabled by default.

`-mno-verbose-error'
     This option disables verbose error messages in AArch64 gas.

9.1.2 Architecture Extensions
-----------------------------

The table below lists the permitted architecture extensions that are
supported by the assembler and the conditions under which they are
automatically enabled.

   Multiple extensions may be specified, separated by a `+'.  Extension
mnemonics may also be removed from those the assembler accepts.  This
is done by prepending `no' to the option that adds the extension.
Extensions that are removed must be listed after all extensions that
have been added.

   Enabling an extension that requires other extensions will
automatically cause those extensions to be enabled.  Similarly,
disabling an extension that is required by other extensions will
automatically cause those extensions to be disabled.

9.1.3.1 Special Characters
..........................

The presence of a `//' on a line indicates the start of a comment that
extends to the end of the current line.  If a `#' appears as the first
character of a line, the whole line is treated as a comment.

   The `;' character can be used instead of a newline to separate
statements.

   The `#' can be optionally used to indicate immediate operands.

9.1.3.3 Relocations
...................

Relocations for `MOVZ' and `MOVK' instructions can be generated by
prefixing the label with `#:abs_g2:' etc.  For example to load the
48-bit absolute address of FOO into x0:

             movz x0, #:abs_g2:foo		// bits 32-47, overflow check
             movk x0, #:abs_g1_nc:foo	// bits 16-31, no overflow check
             movk x0, #:abs_g0_nc:foo	// bits  0-15, no overflow check

   Relocations for `ADRP', and `ADD', `LDR' or `STR' instructions can
be generated by prefixing the label with `:pg_hi21:' and `#:lo12:'
respectively.

   For example to use 33-bit (+/-4GB) pc-relative addressing to load
the address of FOO into x0:

             adrp x0, :pg_hi21:foo
             add  x0, x0, #:lo12:foo

   Or to load the value of FOO into x0:

             adrp x0, :pg_hi21:foo
             ldr  x0, [x0, #:lo12:foo]

   Note that `:pg_hi21:' is optional.

             adrp x0, foo

   is equivalent to

             adrp x0, :pg_hi21:foo

File: as.info,  Node: AArch64 Directives,  Next: AArch64 Opcodes,  Prev: AArch64 Floating Point,  Up: AArch64-Dependent

9.1.5 AArch64 Machine Directives
--------------------------------

`.arch NAME'
     Select the target architecture.  Valid values for NAME are the
     same as for the `-march' commandline option.

     Specifying `.arch' clears any previously selected architecture
     extensions.

`.arch_extension NAME'
     Add or remove an architecture extension to the target
     architecture.  Valid values for NAME are the same as those
     accepted as architectural extensions by the `-mcpu' commandline
     option.

     `.arch_extension' may be used multiple times to add or remove
     extensions incrementally to the architecture being compiled for.

`.bss'
     This directive switches to the `.bss' section.

`.cpu NAME'
     Set the target processor.  Valid values for NAME are the same as
     those accepted by the `-mcpu=' command line option.

`.dword EXPRESSIONS'
     The `.dword' directive produces 64 bit values.

`.even'
     The `.even' directive aligns the output on the next even byte
     boundary.

`.inst EXPRESSIONS'
     Inserts the expressions into the output as if they were
     instructions, rather than data.

`.ltorg'
     This directive causes the current contents of the literal pool to
     be dumped into the current section (which is assumed to be the
     .text section) at the current location (aligned to a word
     boundary).  GAS maintains a separate literal pool for each section
     and each sub-section.  The `.ltorg' directive will only affect the
     literal pool of the current section and sub-section.  At the end
     of assembly all remaining, un-empty literal pools will
     automatically be dumped.

     Note - older versions of GAS would dump the current literal pool
     any time a section change occurred.  This is no longer done, since
     it prevents accurate control of the placement of literal pools.

`.pool'
     This is a synonym for .ltorg.

`NAME .req REGISTER NAME'
     This creates an alias for REGISTER NAME called NAME.  For example:

                  foo .req w0

``.tlsdescadd''
     Emits a TLSDESC_ADD reloc on the next instruction.

``.tlsdesccall''
     Emits a TLSDESC_CALL reloc on the next instruction.

``.tlsdescldr''
     Emits a TLSDESC_LDR reloc on the next instruction.

`.unreq ALIAS-NAME'
     This undefines a register alias which was previously defined using
     the `req' directive.  For example:

                  foo .req w0
                  .unreq foo

     An error occurs if the name is undefined.  Note - this pseudo op
     can be used to delete builtin in register name aliases (eg 'w0').
     This should only be done if it is really necessary.

`.xword EXPRESSIONS'
     The `.xword' directive produces 64 bit values.  This is the same
     as the `.dword' directive.

9.1.6 Opcodes
-------------

GAS implements all the standard AArch64 opcodes.  It also implements
several pseudo opcodes, including several synthetic load instructions.

`LDR ='
            ldr <register> , =<expression>

     The constant expression will be placed into the nearest literal
     pool (if it not already there) and a PC-relative LDR instruction
     will be generated.

9.1.7 Mapping Symbols
---------------------

The AArch64 ELF specification requires that special symbols be inserted
into object files to mark certain features:

`$x'
     At the start of a region of code containing AArch64 instructions.

`$d'
     At the start of a region of data.

these formats are not yet documented.


File: as.info,  Node: Alpha Options,  Next: Alpha Syntax,  Prev: Alpha Notes,  Up: Alpha-Dependent

9.2.2 Options
-------------

`-mCPU'
     This option specifies the target processor.  If an attempt is made
     to assemble an instruction which will not execute on the target
     processor, the assembler may either expand the instruction as a
     macro or issue an error message.  This option is equivalent to the
     `.arch' directive.

     The following processor names are recognized: `21064', `21064a',
     `21066', `21068', `21164', `21164a', `21164pc', `21264', `21264a',
     `21264b', `ev4', `ev5', `lca45', `ev5', `ev56', `pca56', `ev6',
     `ev67', `ev68'.  The special name `all' may be used to allow the
     assembler to accept instructions valid for any Alpha processor.

     In order to support existing practice in OSF/1 with respect to
     `.arch', and existing practice within `MILO' (the Linux ARC
     bootloader), the numbered processor names (e.g. 21064) enable the
     processor-specific PALcode instructions, while the
     "electro-vlasic" names (e.g. `ev4') do not.

`-mdebug'
`-no-mdebug'
     Enables or disables the generation of `.mdebug' encapsulation for
     stabs directives and procedure descriptors.  The default is to
     automatically enable `.mdebug' when the first stabs directive is
     seen.

`-relax'
     This option forces all relocations to be put into the object file,
     instead of saving space and resolving some relocations at assembly
     time.  Note that this option does not propagate all symbol
     arithmetic into the object file, because not all symbol arithmetic
     can be represented.  However, the option can still be useful in
     specific applications.

`-replace'
`-noreplace'
     Enables or disables the optimization of procedure calls, both at
     assemblage and at link time.  These options are only available for
     VMS targets and `-replace' is the default.  See section 1.4.1 of
     the OpenVMS Linker Utility Manual.

`-g'
     This option is used when the compiler generates debug information.
     When `gcc' is using `mips-tfile' to generate debug information
     for ECOFF, local labels must be passed through to the object file.
     Otherwise this option has no effect.

`-GSIZE'
     A local common symbol larger than SIZE is placed in `.bss', while
     smaller symbols are placed in `.sbss'.

`-F'
`-32addr'
     These options are ignored for backward compatibility.

......................

The 32 integer registers are referred to as `$N' or `$rN'.  In
addition, registers 15, 28, 29, and 30 may be referred to by the
symbols `$fp', `$at', `$gp', and `$sp' respectively.

   The 32 floating-point registers are referred to as `$fN'.


File: as.info,  Node: Alpha-Relocs,  Prev: Alpha-Regs,  Up: Alpha Syntax

9.2.3.3 Relocations
...................

Some of these relocations are available for ECOFF, but mostly only for
ELF.  They are modeled after the relocation format introduced in
Digital Unix 4.0, but there are additions.

   The format is `!TAG' or `!TAG!NUMBER' where TAG is the name of the
relocation.  In some cases NUMBER is used to relate specific
instructions.

   The relocation is placed at the end of the instruction like so:

     ldah  $0,a($29)    !gprelhigh
     lda   $0,a($0)     !gprellow
     ldq   $1,b($29)    !literal!100
     ldl   $2,0($1)     !lituse_base!100

`!literal'
`!literal!N'
     Used with an `ldq' instruction to load the address of a symbol
     from the GOT.

     A sequence number N is optional, and if present is used to pair
     `lituse' relocations with this `literal' relocation.  The `lituse'
     relocations are used by the linker to optimize the code based on
     the final location of the symbol.

     Note that these optimizations are dependent on the data flow of the
     program.  Therefore, if _any_ `lituse' is paired with a `literal'
     relocation, then _all_ uses of the register set by the `literal'
     instruction must also be marked with `lituse' relocations.  This
     is because the original `literal' instruction may be deleted or
     transformed into another instruction.

     Also note that there may be a one-to-many relationship between
     `literal' and `lituse', but not a many-to-one.  That is, if there
     are two code paths that load up the same address and feed the
     value to a single use, then the use may not use a `lituse'
     relocation.

`!lituse_base!N'
     Used with any memory format instruction (e.g. `ldl') to indicate
     that the literal is used for an address load.  The offset field of
     the instruction must be zero.  During relaxation, the code may be
     altered to use a gp-relative load.

`!lituse_jsr!N'
     Used with a register branch format instruction (e.g. `jsr') to
     indicate that the literal is used for a call.  During relaxation,
     the code may be altered to use a direct branch (e.g. `bsr').

`!lituse_jsrdirect!N'
     Similar to `lituse_jsr', but also that this call cannot be vectored
     through a PLT entry.  This is useful for functions with special
     calling conventions which do not allow the normal call-clobbered
     registers to be clobbered.

`!lituse_bytoff!N'
     Used with a byte mask instruction (e.g. `extbl') to indicate that
     only the low 3 bits of the address are relevant.  During
     relaxation, the code may be altered to use an immediate instead of
     a register shift.

`!lituse_addr!N'
     Used with any other instruction to indicate that the original
     address is in fact used, and the original `ldq' instruction may
     not be altered or deleted.  This is useful in conjunction with
     `lituse_jsr' to test whether a weak symbol is defined.

          ldq  $27,foo($29)   !literal!1
          beq  $27,is_undef   !lituse_addr!1
          jsr  $26,($27),foo  !lituse_jsr!1

`!lituse_tlsgd!N'
     Used with a register branch format instruction to indicate that the
     literal is the call to `__tls_get_addr' used to compute the
     address of the thread-local storage variable whose descriptor was
     loaded with `!tlsgd!N'.

`!lituse_tlsldm!N'
     Used with a register branch format instruction to indicate that the
     literal is the call to `__tls_get_addr' used to compute the
     address of the base of the thread-local storage block for the
     current module.  The descriptor for the module must have been
     loaded with `!tlsldm!N'.

`!gpdisp!N'
     Used with `ldah' and `lda' to load the GP from the current
     address, a-la the `ldgp' macro.  The source register for the
     `ldah' instruction must contain the address of the `ldah'
     instruction.  There must be exactly one `lda' instruction paired
     with the `ldah' instruction, though it may appear anywhere in the
     instruction stream.  The immediate operands must be zero.

          bsr  $26,foo
          ldah $29,0($26)     !gpdisp!1
          lda  $29,0($29)     !gpdisp!1

`!gprelhigh'
     Used with an `ldah' instruction to add the high 16 bits of a
     32-bit displacement from the GP.

`!gprellow'
     Used with any memory format instruction to add the low 16 bits of a
     32-bit displacement from the GP.

`!gprel'
     Used with any memory format instruction to add a 16-bit
     displacement from the GP.

`!samegp'
     Used with any branch format instruction to skip the GP load at the
     target address.  The referenced symbol must have the same GP as the
     source object file, and it must be declared to either not use `$27'
     or perform a standard GP load in the first two instructions via the
     `.prologue' directive.

`!tlsgd'
`!tlsgd!N'
     Used with an `lda' instruction to load the address of a TLS
     descriptor for a symbol in the GOT.

     The sequence number N is optional, and if present it used to pair
     the descriptor load with both the `literal' loading the address of
     the `__tls_get_addr' function and the `lituse_tlsgd' marking the
     call to that function.

     For proper relaxation, both the `tlsgd', `literal' and `lituse'
     relocations must be in the same extended basic block.  That is,
     the relocation with the lowest address must be executed first at
     runtime.

`!tlsldm'
`!tlsldm!N'
     Used with an `lda' instruction to load the address of a TLS
     descriptor for the current module in the GOT.

     Similar in other respects to `tlsgd'.

`!gotdtprel'
     Used with an `ldq' instruction to load the offset of the TLS
     symbol within its module's thread-local storage block.  Also known
     as the dynamic thread pointer offset or dtp-relative offset.

`!dtprelhi'
`!dtprello'
`!dtprel'
     Like `gprel' relocations except they compute dtp-relative offsets.

`!gottprel'
     Used with an `ldq' instruction to load the offset of the TLS
     symbol from the thread pointer.  Also known as the tp-relative
     offset.

`!tprelhi'
`!tprello'
`!tprel'
     Like `gprel' relocations except they compute tp-relative offsets.

9.2.5 Alpha Assembler Directives
--------------------------------

`as' for the Alpha supports many additional directives for
compatibility with the native assembler.  This section describes them
only briefly.

   These are the additional directives in `as' for the Alpha:

`.arch CPU'
     Specifies the target processor.  This is equivalent to the `-mCPU'
     command-line option.  *Note Options: Alpha Options, for a list of
     values for CPU.

`.ent FUNCTION[, N]'
     Mark the beginning of FUNCTION.  An optional number may follow for
     compatibility with the OSF/1 assembler, but is ignored.  When
     generating `.mdebug' information, this will create a procedure
     descriptor for the function.  In ELF, it will mark the symbol as a
     function a-la the generic `.type' directive.

`.end FUNCTION'
     Mark the end of FUNCTION.  In ELF, it will set the size of the
     symbol a-la the generic `.size' directive.

`.mask MASK, OFFSET'
     Indicate which of the integer registers are saved in the current
     function's stack frame.  MASK is interpreted a bit mask in which
     bit N set indicates that register N is saved.  The registers are
     saved in a block located OFFSET bytes from the "canonical frame
     address" (CFA) which is the value of the stack pointer on entry to
     the function.  The registers are saved sequentially, except that
     the return address register (normally `$26') is saved first.

     This and the other directives that describe the stack frame are
     currently only used when generating `.mdebug' information.  They
     may in the future be used to generate DWARF2 `.debug_frame' unwind
     information for hand written assembly.

`.fmask MASK, OFFSET'
     Indicate which of the floating-point registers are saved in the
     current stack frame.  The MASK and OFFSET parameters are
     interpreted as with `.mask'.

`.frame FRAMEREG, FRAMEOFFSET, RETREG[, ARGOFFSET]'
     Describes the shape of the stack frame.  The frame pointer in use
     is FRAMEREG; normally this is either `$fp' or `$sp'.  The frame
     pointer is FRAMEOFFSET bytes below the CFA.  The return address is
     initially located in RETREG until it is saved as indicated in
     `.mask'.  For compatibility with OSF/1 an optional ARGOFFSET
     parameter is accepted and ignored.  It is believed to indicate the
     offset from the CFA to the saved argument registers.

`.prologue N'
     Indicate that the stack frame is set up and all registers have been
     spilled.  The argument N indicates whether and how the function
     uses the incoming "procedure vector" (the address of the called
     function) in `$27'.  0 indicates that `$27' is not used; 1
     indicates that the first two instructions of the function use `$27'
     to perform a load of the GP register; 2 indicates that `$27' is
     used in some non-standard way and so the linker cannot elide the
     load of the procedure vector during relaxation.

`.usepv FUNCTION, WHICH'
     Used to indicate the use of the `$27' register, similar to
     `.prologue', but without the other semantics of needing to be
     inside an open `.ent'/`.end' block.

     The WHICH argument should be either `no', indicating that `$27' is
     not used, or `std', indicating that the first two instructions of
     the function perform a GP load.

     One might use this directive instead of `.prologue' if you are
     also using dwarf2 CFI directives.

`.gprel32 EXPRESSION'
     Computes the difference between the address in EXPRESSION and the
     GP for the current object file, and stores it in 4 bytes.  In
     addition to being smaller than a full 8 byte address, this also
     does not require a dynamic relocation when used in a shared
     library.

`.t_floating EXPRESSION'
     Stores EXPRESSION as an IEEE double precision value.

`.s_floating EXPRESSION'
     Stores EXPRESSION as an IEEE single precision value.

`.f_floating EXPRESSION'
     Stores EXPRESSION as a VAX F format value.

`.g_floating EXPRESSION'
     Stores EXPRESSION as a VAX G format value.

`.d_floating EXPRESSION'
     Stores EXPRESSION as a VAX D format value.

`.set FEATURE'
     Enables or disables various assembler features.  Using the positive
     name of the feature enables while using `noFEATURE' disables.

    `at'
          Indicates that macro expansions may clobber the "assembler
          temporary" (`$at' or `$28') register.  Some macros may not be
          expanded without this and will generate an error message if
          `noat' is in effect.  When `at' is in effect, a warning will
          be generated if `$at' is used by the programmer.

    `macro'
          Enables the expansion of macro instructions.  Note that
          variants of real instructions, such as `br label' vs `br
          $31,label' are considered alternate forms and not macros.

    `move'
    `reorder'
    `volatile'
          These control whether and how the assembler may re-order
          instructions.  Accepted for compatibility with the OSF/1
          assembler, but `as' does not do instruction scheduling, so
          these features are ignored.

   The following directives are recognized for compatibility with the
OSF/1 assembler but are ignored.

     .proc           .aproc
     .reguse         .livereg
     .option         .aent
     .ugen           .eflag

------------

* Menu:

* ARC-Chars::                Special Characters
* ARC-Regs::                 Register Names


File: as.info,  Node: ARC-Chars,  Next: ARC-Regs,  Up: ARC Syntax

9.3.2.1 Special Characters
..........................

`%'
     A register name can optionally be prefixed by a `%' character.  So
     register `%r0' is equivalent to `r0' in the assembly code.

`#'
     The presence of a `#' character within a line (but not at the
     start of a line) indicates the start of a comment that extends to
     the end of the current line.

     _Note:_ if a line starts with a `#' character then it can also be
     a logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a
     preprocessor control command (*note Preprocessing::).

`@'
     Prefixing an operand with an `@' specifies that the operand is a
     symbol and not a register.  This is how the assembler disambiguates
     the use of an ARC register name as a symbol.  So the instruction
          mov r0, @r0
     moves the address of symbol `r0' into register `r0'.

``'
     The ``' (backtick) character is used to separate statements on a
     single line.

`-'
     Used as a separator to obtain a sequence of commands from a C
     preprocessor macro.



File: as.info,  Node: ARC-Regs,  Prev: ARC-Chars,  Up: ARC Syntax

9.3.2.2 Register Names
......................

The ARC assembler uses the following register names for its core
registers:

`r0-r31'
     The core general registers.  Registers `r26' through `r31' have
     special functions, and are usually referred to by those synonyms.

`gp'
     The global pointer and a synonym for `r26'.

`fp'
     The frame pointer and a synonym for `r27'.

`sp'
     The stack pointer and a synonym for `r28'.

`ilink1'
     For ARC 600 and ARC 700, the level 1 interrupt link register and a
     synonym for `r29'.  Not supported for ARCv2.

`ilink'
     For ARCv2, the interrupt link register and a synonym for `r29'.
     Not supported for ARC 600 and ARC 700.

`ilink2'
     For ARC 600 and ARC 700, the level 2 interrupt link register and a
     synonym for `r30'.  Not supported for ARC v2.

`blink'
     The link register and a synonym for `r31'.

`r32-r59'
     The extension core registers.

`lp_count'
     The loop count register.

`pcl'
     The word aligned program counter.


   In addition the ARC processor has a large number of _auxiliary
registers_.  The precise set depends on the extensions being supported,
but the following baseline set are always defined:

`identity'
     Processor Identification register.  Auxiliary register address 0x4.

`pc'
     Program Counter.  Auxiliary register address 0x6.

`status32'
     Status register.  Auxiliary register address 0x0a.

`bta'
     Branch Target Address.  Auxiliary register address 0x412.

`ecr'
     Exception Cause Register.  Auxiliary register address 0x403.

`int_vector_base'
     Interrupt Vector Base address.  Auxiliary register address 0x25.

`erstatus'
     STATUS32 saved on exception.  Auxiliary register address 0x402.

`bcr_ver'
     Build Configuration Registers Version.  Auxiliary register address

9.3.3 ARC Machine Directives
----------------------------

The ARC version of `as' supports the following additional machine
directives:

`.lcomm SYMBOL, LENGTH[, ALIGNMENT]'
     Reserve LENGTH (an absolute expression) bytes for a local common
     denoted by SYMBOL.  The section and value of SYMBOL are those of
     the new local common.  The addresses are allocated in the bss
     section, so that at run-time the bytes start off zeroed.  Since
     SYMBOL is not declared global, it is normally not visible to `ld'.
     The optional third parameter, ALIGNMENT, specifies the desired
     alignment of the symbol in the bss section, specified as a byte
     boundary (for example, an alignment of 16 means that the least
     significant 4 bits of the address should be zero).  The alignment
     must be an absolute expression, and it must be a power of two.  If
     no alignment is specified, as will set the alignment to the
     largest power of two less than or equal to the size of the symbol,
     up to a maximum of 16.

`.lcommon SYMBOL, LENGTH[, ALIGNMENT]'
     The same as `lcomm' directive.

`.cpu CPU'
     The `.cpu' directive must be followed by the desired core version.
     Permitted values for CPU are:
    `ARC600'
          Assemble for the ARC600 instruction set.

    `arc600_norm'
          Assemble for ARC 600 with norm instructions.

    `arc600_mul64'
          Assemble for ARC 600 with mul64 instructions.

    `arc600_mul32x16'
          Assemble for ARC 600 with mul32x16 instructions.

    `arc601'
          Assemble for ARC 601 instruction set.

    `arc601_norm'
          Assemble for ARC 601 with norm instructions.

    `arc601_mul64'
          Assemble for ARC 601 with mul64 instructions.

    `arc601_mul32x16'
          Assemble for ARC 601 with mul32x16 instructions.

    `ARC700'
          Assemble for the ARC700 instruction set.

    `NPS400'
          Assemble for the NPS400 instruction set.

    `EM'
          Assemble for the ARC EM instruction set.

    `arcem'
          Assemble for ARC EM instruction set

    `em4'
          Assemble for ARC EM with code-density instructions.

    `em4_dmips'
          Assemble for ARC EM with code-density instructions.

    `em4_fpus'
          Assemble for ARC EM with code-density instructions.

    `em4_fpuda'
          Assemble for ARC EM with code-density, and double-precision
          assist instructions.

    `quarkse_em'
          Assemble for QuarkSE-EM instruction set.

    `HS'
          Assemble for the ARC HS instruction set.

    `archs'
          Assemble for ARC HS instruction set.

    `hs'
          Assemble for ARC HS instruction set.

    `hs34'
          Assemble for ARC HS34 instruction set.

    `hs38'
          Assemble for ARC HS38 instruction set.

    `hs38_linux'
          Assemble for ARC HS38 with floating point support on.


     Note: the `.cpu' directive overrides the command line option
     `-mcpu=CPU'; a warning is emitted when the version is not
     consistent between the two.

`.extAuxRegister NAME, ADDR, MODE'
     Auxiliary registers can be defined in the assembler source code by
     using this directive.  The first parameter, NAME, is the name of
     the new auxiliary register.  The second parameter, ADDR, is
     address the of the auxiliary register.  The third parameter, MODE,
     specifies whether the register is readable and/or writable and is
     one of:
    `r'
          Read only;

    `w'
          Write only;

    `r|w'
          Read and write.


     For example:
          	.extAuxRegister mulhi, 0x12, w
     specifies a write only extension auxiliary register, MULHI at
     address 0x12.

`.extCondCode SUFFIX, VAL'
     ARC supports extensible condition codes.  This directive defines a
     new condition code, to be known by the suffix, SUFFIX and will
     depend on the value, VAL in the condition code.

     For example:
          	.extCondCode is_busy,0x14
          	add.is_busy  r1,r2,r3
     will only execute the `add' instruction if the condition code
     value is 0x14.

`.extCoreRegister NAME, REGNUM, MODE, SHORTCUT'
     Specifies an extension core register named NAME as a synonym for
     the register numbered REGNUM.  The register number must be between
     32 and 59.  The third argument, MODE, indicates whether the
     register is readable and/or writable and is one of:
    `r'
          Read only;

    `w'
          Write only;

    `r|w'
          Read and write.


     The final parameter, SHORTCUT indicates whether the register has a
     short cut in the pipeline.  The valid values are:
    `can_shortcut'
          The register has a short cut in the pipeline;

    `cannot_shortcut'
          The register does not have a short cut in the pipeline.

     For example:
          	.extCoreRegister mlo, 57, r , can_shortcut
     defines a read only extension core register, `mlo', which is
     register 57, and can short cut the pipeline.

`.extInstruction NAME, OPCODE, SUBOPCODE, SUFFIXCLASS, SYNTAXCLASS'
     ARC allows the user to specify extension instructions.  These
     extension instructions are not macros; the assembler creates
     encodings for use of these instructions according to the
     specification by the user.

     The first argument, NAME, gives the name of the instruction.

     The second argument, OPCODE, is the opcode to be used (bits 31:27
     in the encoding).

     The third argument, SUBOPCODE, is the sub-opcode to be used, but
     the correct value also depends on the fifth argument, SYNTAXCLASS

     The fourth argument, SUFFIXCLASS, determines the kinds of suffixes
     to be allowed.  Valid values are:
    `SUFFIX_NONE'
          No suffixes are permitted;

    `SUFFIX_COND'
          Conditional suffixes are permitted;

    `SUFFIX_FLAG'
          Flag setting suffixes are permitted.

    `SUFFIX_COND|SUFFIX_FLAG'
          Both conditional and flag setting suffices are permitted.


     The fifth and final argument, SYNTAXCLASS, determines the syntax
     class for the instruction.  It can have the following values:
    `SYNTAX_2OP'
          Two Operand Instruction;

    `SYNTAX_3OP'
          Three Operand Instruction.

    `SYNTAX_1OP'
          One Operand Instruction.

    `SYNTAX_NOP'
          No Operand Instruction.

     The syntax class may be followed by `|' and one of the following
     modifiers.
    `OP1_MUST_BE_IMM'
          Modifies syntax class `SYNTAX_3OP', specifying that the first
          operand of a three-operand instruction must be an immediate
          (i.e., the result is discarded).  This is usually used to set
          the flags using specific instructions and not retain results.

    `OP1_IMM_IMPLIED'
          Modifies syntax class `SYNTAX_20P', specifying that there is
          an implied immediate destination operand which does not
          appear in the syntax.

          For example, if the source code contains an instruction like:
               inst r1,r2
          the first argument is an implied immediate (that is, the
          result is discarded).  This is the same as though the source
          code were: inst 0,r1,r2.


     For example, defining a 64-bit multiplier with immediate operands:
          	.extInstruction  mp64, 0x07, 0x2d, SUFFIX_COND|SUFFIX_FLAG,
          			 SYNTAX_3OP|OP1_MUST_BE_IMM
     which specifies an extension instruction named `mp64' with 3
     operands.  It sets the flags and can be used with a condition code,
     for which the first operand is an immediate, i.e. equivalent to
     discarding the result of the operation.

     A two operands instruction variant would be:
          	.extInstruction mul64, 0x07, 0x2d, SUFFIX_COND,
          	SYNTAX_2OP|OP1_IMM_IMPLIED
     which describes a two operand instruction with an implicit first
     immediate operand.  The result of this operation would be
     discarded.

`.arc_attribute TAG, VALUE'
     Set the ARC object attribute TAG to VALUE.

     The TAG is either an attribute number, or one of the following:
     `Tag_ARC_PCS_config', `Tag_ARC_CPU_base', `Tag_ARC_CPU_variation',
     `Tag_ARC_CPU_name', `Tag_ARC_ABI_rf16', `Tag_ARC_ABI_osver',
     `Tag_ARC_ABI_sda', `Tag_ARC_ABI_pic', `Tag_ARC_ABI_tls',
     `Tag_ARC_ABI_enumsize', `Tag_ARC_ABI_exceptions',
     `Tag_ARC_ABI_double_size', `Tag_ARC_ISA_config',
     `Tag_ARC_ISA_apex', `Tag_ARC_ISA_mpy_option'

     The VALUE is either a `number', `"string"', or `number, "string"'
     depending on the tag.

9.3.4 ARC Assembler Modifiers
-----------------------------

The following additional assembler modifiers have been added for
position-independent code.  These modifiers are available only with the
ARC 700 and above processors and generate relocation entries, which are
interpreted by the linker as follows:

`@pcl(SYMBOL)'
     Relative distance of SYMBOL's from the current program counter
     location.

`@gotpc(SYMBOL)'
     Relative distance of SYMBOL's Global Offset Table entry from the
     current program counter location.

`@gotoff(SYMBOL)'
     Distance of SYMBOL from the base of the Global Offset Table.

`@plt(SYMBOL)'
     Distance of SYMBOL's Procedure Linkage Table entry from the
     current program counter.  This is valid only with branch and link
     instructions and PC-relative calls.

`@sda(SYMBOL)'
     Relative distance of SYMBOL from the base of the Small Data
     Pointer.

position-independent code.  These symbols are available only with the
ARC 700 and above processors.

`__GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE__'
     Symbol referring to the base of the Global Offset Table.

`__DYNAMIC__'
     An alias for the Global Offset Table
     `Base__GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE__'.  It can be used only with `@gotpc'

9.4.1 Options
-------------

`-mcpu=PROCESSOR[+EXTENSION...]'
     This option specifies the target processor.  The assembler will
     issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an
     instruction which will not execute on the target processor.  The
     following processor names are recognized: `arm1', `arm2', `arm250',
     `arm3', `arm6', `arm60', `arm600', `arm610', `arm620', `arm7',
     `arm7m', `arm7d', `arm7dm', `arm7di', `arm7dmi', `arm70', `arm700',

     `cortex-a9', `cortex-a15', `cortex-a17', `cortex-a32',
     `cortex-a35', `cortex-a53', `cortex-a57', `cortex-a72',
     `cortex-a73', `cortex-r4', `cortex-r4f', `cortex-r5', `cortex-r7',

     `xgene1', `xgene2', `ep9312' (ARM920 with Cirrus Maverick
     coprocessor), `i80200' (Intel XScale processor) `iwmmxt' (Intel(r)
     XScale processor with Wireless MMX(tm) technology coprocessor) and
     `xscale'.  The special name `all' may be used to allow the
     assembler to accept instructions valid for any ARM processor.

     In addition to the basic instruction set, the assembler can be
     told to accept various extension mnemonics that extend the
     processor using the co-processor instruction space.  For example,
     `-mcpu=arm920+maverick' is equivalent to specifying `-mcpu=ep9312'.

     Multiple extensions may be specified, separated by a `+'.  The
     extensions should be specified in ascending alphabetical order.

     Some extensions may be restricted to particular architectures;
     this is documented in the list of extensions below.

     Extension mnemonics may also be removed from those the assembler
     accepts.  This is done be prepending `no' to the option that adds
     the extension.  Extensions that are removed should be listed after
     all extensions which have been added, again in ascending
     alphabetical order.  For example, `-mcpu=ep9312+nomaverick' is
     equivalent to specifying `-mcpu=arm920'.

     The following extensions are currently supported: `crc' `crypto'
     (Cryptography Extensions for v8-A architecture, implies `fp+simd'),
     `fp' (Floating Point Extensions for v8-A architecture), `idiv'
     (Integer Divide Extensions for v7-A and v7-R architectures),
     `iwmmxt', `iwmmxt2', `xscale', `maverick', `mp' (Multiprocessing
     Extensions for v7-A and v7-R architectures), `os' (Operating
     System for v6M architecture), `sec' (Security Extensions for v6K
     and v7-A architectures), `simd' (Advanced SIMD Extensions for v8-A
     architecture, implies `fp'), `virt' (Virtualization Extensions for
     v7-A architecture, implies `idiv'), `pan' (Privileged Access Never
     Extensions for v8-A architecture), `ras' (Reliability,
     Availability and Serviceability extensions for v8-A architecture),
     `rdma' (ARMv8.1 Advanced SIMD extensions for v8-A architecture,
     implies `simd') and `xscale'.

`-march=ARCHITECTURE[+EXTENSION...]'
     This option specifies the target architecture.  The assembler will
     issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an
     instruction which will not execute on the target architecture.
     The following architecture names are recognized: `armv1', `armv2',
     `armv2a', `armv2s', `armv3', `armv3m', `armv4', `armv4xm',
     `armv4t', `armv4txm', `armv5', `armv5t', `armv5txm', `armv5te',
     `armv5texp', `armv6', `armv6j', `armv6k', `armv6z', `armv6kz',
     `armv6-m', `armv6s-m', `armv7', `armv7-a', `armv7ve', `armv7-r',
     `armv7-m', `armv7e-m', `armv8-a', `armv8.1-a', `armv8.2-a',
     `armv8.3-a', `iwmmxt' `iwmmxt2' and `xscale'.  If both `-mcpu' and
     `-march' are specified, the assembler will use the setting for
     `-mcpu'.

     The architecture option can be extended with the same instruction
     set extension options as the `-mcpu' option.

`-mfpu=FLOATING-POINT-FORMAT'
     This option specifies the floating point format to assemble for.
     The assembler will issue an error message if an attempt is made to
     assemble an instruction which will not execute on the target
     floating point unit.  The following format options are recognized:
     `softfpa', `fpe', `fpe2', `fpe3', `fpa', `fpa10', `fpa11',
     `arm7500fe', `softvfp', `softvfp+vfp', `vfp', `vfp10', `vfp10-r0',
     `vfp9', `vfpxd', `vfpv2', `vfpv3', `vfpv3-fp16', `vfpv3-d16',
     `vfpv3-d16-fp16', `vfpv3xd', `vfpv3xd-d16', `vfpv4', `vfpv4-d16',
     `fpv4-sp-d16', `fpv5-sp-d16', `fpv5-d16', `fp-armv8', `arm1020t',
     `arm1020e', `arm1136jf-s', `maverick', `neon', `neon-vfpv3',
     `neon-fp16', `neon-vfpv4', `neon-fp-armv8', `crypto-neon-fp-armv8',
     `neon-fp-armv8.1' and `crypto-neon-fp-armv8.1'.

     In addition to determining which instructions are assembled, this
     option also affects the way in which the `.double' assembler
     directive behaves when assembling little-endian code.

     The default is dependent on the processor selected.  For
     Architecture 5 or later, the default is to assemble for VFP
     instructions; for earlier architectures the default is to assemble
     for FPA instructions.

`-mthumb'
     This option specifies that the assembler should start assembling
     Thumb instructions; that is, it should behave as though the file
     starts with a `.code 16' directive.

`-mthumb-interwork'
     This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler
     should be marked as supporting interworking.

`-mimplicit-it=never'
`-mimplicit-it=always'
`-mimplicit-it=arm'
`-mimplicit-it=thumb'
     The `-mimplicit-it' option controls the behavior of the assembler
     when conditional instructions are not enclosed in IT blocks.
     There are four possible behaviors.  If `never' is specified, such
     constructs cause a warning in ARM code and an error in Thumb-2
     code.  If `always' is specified, such constructs are accepted in
     both ARM and Thumb-2 code, where the IT instruction is added
     implicitly.  If `arm' is specified, such constructs are accepted
     in ARM code and cause an error in Thumb-2 code.  If `thumb' is
     specified, such constructs cause a warning in ARM code and are
     accepted in Thumb-2 code.  If you omit this option, the behavior
     is equivalent to `-mimplicit-it=arm'.

`-mapcs-26'
`-mapcs-32'
     These options specify that the output generated by the assembler
     should be marked as supporting the indicated version of the Arm
     Procedure.  Calling Standard.

`-matpcs'
     This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler
     should be marked as supporting the Arm/Thumb Procedure Calling
     Standard.  If enabled this option will cause the assembler to
     create an empty debugging section in the object file called
     .arm.atpcs.  Debuggers can use this to determine the ABI being
     used by.

`-mapcs-float'
     This indicates the floating point variant of the APCS should be
     used.  In this variant floating point arguments are passed in FP
     registers rather than integer registers.

`-mapcs-reentrant'
     This indicates that the reentrant variant of the APCS should be
     used.  This variant supports position independent code.

`-mfloat-abi=ABI'
     This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler
     should be marked as using specified floating point ABI.  The
     following values are recognized: `soft', `softfp' and `hard'.

`-meabi=VER'
     This option specifies which EABI version the produced object files
     should conform to.  The following values are recognized: `gnu', `4'
     and `5'.

`-EB'
     This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler
     should be marked as being encoded for a big-endian processor.

     Note: If a program is being built for a system with big-endian data
     and little-endian instructions then it should be assembled with the
     `-EB' option, (all of it, code and data) and then linked with the
     `--be8' option.  This will reverse the endianness of the
     instructions back to little-endian, but leave the data as
     big-endian.

`-EL'
     This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler
     should be marked as being encoded for a little-endian processor.

`-k'
     This option specifies that the output of the assembler should be
     marked as position-independent code (PIC).

`--fix-v4bx'
     Allow `BX' instructions in ARMv4 code.  This is intended for use
     with the linker option of the same name.

`-mwarn-deprecated'
`-mno-warn-deprecated'
     Enable or disable warnings about using deprecated options or
     features.  The default is to warn.

`-mccs'
     Turns on CodeComposer Studio assembly syntax compatibility mode.

`-mwarn-syms'
`-mno-warn-syms'
     Enable or disable warnings about symbols that match the names of
     ARM instructions.  The default is to warn.

9.4.2.1 Instruction Set Syntax
..............................

Two slightly different syntaxes are support for ARM and THUMB
instructions.  The default, `divided', uses the old style where ARM and
THUMB instructions had their own, separate syntaxes.  The new,
`unified' syntax, which can be selected via the `.syntax' directive,
and has the following main features:

   * Immediate operands do not require a `#' prefix.

   * The `IT' instruction may appear, and if it does it is validated
     against subsequent conditional affixes.  In ARM mode it does not
     generate machine code, in THUMB mode it does.

   * For ARM instructions the conditional affixes always appear at the
     end of the instruction.  For THUMB instructions conditional
     affixes can be used, but only inside the scope of an `IT'
     instruction.

   * All of the instructions new to the V6T2 architecture (and later)
     are available.  (Only a few such instructions can be written in the
     `divided' syntax).

   * The `.N' and `.W' suffixes are recognized and honored.

   * All instructions set the flags if and only if they have an `s'
     affix.

9.4.2.2 Special Characters
..........................

The presence of a `@' anywhere on a line indicates the start of a
comment that extends to the end of that line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The `;' character can be used instead of a newline to separate
statements.

   Either `#' or `$' can be used to indicate immediate operands.

File: as.info,  Node: ARM-Relocations,  Next: ARM-Neon-Alignment,  Prev: ARM-Regs,  Up: ARM Syntax

9.4.2.4 ARM relocation generation
.................................

Specific data relocations can be generated by putting the relocation
name in parentheses after the symbol name.  For example:

             .word foo(TARGET1)

   This will generate an `R_ARM_TARGET1' relocation against the symbol
FOO.  The following relocations are supported: `GOT', `GOTOFF',
`TARGET1', `TARGET2', `SBREL', `TLSGD', `TLSLDM', `TLSLDO', `TLSDESC',
`TLSCALL', `GOTTPOFF', `GOT_PREL' and `TPOFF'.

   For compatibility with older toolchains the assembler also accepts
`(PLT)' after branch targets.  On legacy targets this will generate the
deprecated `R_ARM_PLT32' relocation.  On EABI targets it will encode
either the `R_ARM_CALL' or `R_ARM_JUMP24' relocation, as appropriate.

   Relocations for `MOVW' and `MOVT' instructions can be generated by
prefixing the value with `#:lower16:' and `#:upper16' respectively.
For example to load the 32-bit address of foo into r0:

             MOVW r0, #:lower16:foo
             MOVT r0, #:upper16:foo

   Relocations `R_ARM_THM_ALU_ABS_G0_NC', `R_ARM_THM_ALU_ABS_G1_NC',
`R_ARM_THM_ALU_ABS_G2_NC' and `R_ARM_THM_ALU_ABS_G3_NC' can be
generated by prefixing the value with `#:lower0_7:#', `#:lower8_15:#',
`#:upper0_7:#' and `#:upper8_15:#' respectively.  For example to load
the 32-bit address of foo into r0:

             MOVS r0, #:upper8_15:#foo
             LSLS r0, r0, #8
             ADDS r0, #:upper0_7:#foo
             LSLS r0, r0, #8
             ADDS r0, #:lower8_15:#foo
             LSLS r0, r0, #8
             ADDS r0, #:lower0_7:#foo

9.4.2.5 NEON Alignment Specifiers
.................................

Some NEON load/store instructions allow an optional address alignment
qualifier.  The ARM documentation specifies that this is indicated by
`@ ALIGN'. However GAS already interprets the `@' character as a "line
comment" start, so `: ALIGN' is used instead.  For example:

             vld1.8 {q0}, [r0, :128]

9.4.4 ARM Machine Directives
----------------------------

`.align EXPRESSION [, EXPRESSION]'
     This is the generic .ALIGN directive.  For the ARM however if the
     first argument is zero (ie no alignment is needed) the assembler
     will behave as if the argument had been 2 (ie pad to the next four
     byte boundary).  This is for compatibility with ARM's own
     assembler.

`.arch NAME'
     Select the target architecture.  Valid values for NAME are the
     same as for the `-march' commandline option.

     Specifying `.arch' clears any previously selected architecture
     extensions.

`.arch_extension NAME'
     Add or remove an architecture extension to the target
     architecture.  Valid values for NAME are the same as those
     accepted as architectural extensions by the `-mcpu' commandline
     option.

     `.arch_extension' may be used multiple times to add or remove
     extensions incrementally to the architecture being compiled for.

`.arm'
     This performs the same action as .CODE 32.

`.bss'
     This directive switches to the `.bss' section.

`.cantunwind'
     Prevents unwinding through the current function.  No personality
     routine or exception table data is required or permitted.

`.code `[16|32]''
     This directive selects the instruction set being generated. The
     value 16 selects Thumb, with the value 32 selecting ARM.

`.cpu NAME'
     Select the target processor.  Valid values for NAME are the same as
     for the `-mcpu' commandline option.

     Specifying `.cpu' clears any previously selected architecture
     extensions.

`NAME .dn REGISTER NAME [.TYPE] [[INDEX]]'
`NAME .qn REGISTER NAME [.TYPE] [[INDEX]]'
     The `dn' and `qn' directives are used to create typed and/or
     indexed register aliases for use in Advanced SIMD Extension (Neon)
     instructions.  The former should be used to create aliases of
     double-precision registers, and the latter to create aliases of
     quad-precision registers.

     If these directives are used to create typed aliases, those
     aliases can be used in Neon instructions instead of writing types
     after the mnemonic or after each operand.  For example:

                  x .dn d2.f32
                  y .dn d3.f32
                  z .dn d4.f32[1]
                  vmul x,y,z

     This is equivalent to writing the following:

                  vmul.f32 d2,d3,d4[1]

     Aliases created using `dn' or `qn' can be destroyed using `unreq'.

`.eabi_attribute TAG, VALUE'
     Set the EABI object attribute TAG to VALUE.

     The TAG is either an attribute number, or one of the following:
     `Tag_CPU_raw_name', `Tag_CPU_name', `Tag_CPU_arch',
     `Tag_CPU_arch_profile', `Tag_ARM_ISA_use', `Tag_THUMB_ISA_use',
     `Tag_FP_arch', `Tag_WMMX_arch', `Tag_Advanced_SIMD_arch',
     `Tag_PCS_config', `Tag_ABI_PCS_R9_use', `Tag_ABI_PCS_RW_data',
     `Tag_ABI_PCS_RO_data', `Tag_ABI_PCS_GOT_use',
     `Tag_ABI_PCS_wchar_t', `Tag_ABI_FP_rounding',
     `Tag_ABI_FP_denormal', `Tag_ABI_FP_exceptions',
     `Tag_ABI_FP_user_exceptions', `Tag_ABI_FP_number_model',
     `Tag_ABI_align_needed', `Tag_ABI_align_preserved',
     `Tag_ABI_enum_size', `Tag_ABI_HardFP_use', `Tag_ABI_VFP_args',
     `Tag_ABI_WMMX_args', `Tag_ABI_optimization_goals',
     `Tag_ABI_FP_optimization_goals', `Tag_compatibility',
     `Tag_CPU_unaligned_access', `Tag_FP_HP_extension',
     `Tag_ABI_FP_16bit_format', `Tag_MPextension_use', `Tag_DIV_use',
     `Tag_nodefaults', `Tag_also_compatible_with', `Tag_conformance',
     `Tag_T2EE_use', `Tag_Virtualization_use'

     The VALUE is either a `number', `"string"', or `number, "string"'
     depending on the tag.

     Note - the following legacy values are also accepted by TAG:
     `Tag_VFP_arch', `Tag_ABI_align8_needed',
     `Tag_ABI_align8_preserved', `Tag_VFP_HP_extension',

`.even'
     This directive aligns to an even-numbered address.

`.extend  EXPRESSION [, EXPRESSION]*'
`.ldouble  EXPRESSION [, EXPRESSION]*'
     These directives write 12byte long double floating-point values to
     the output section.  These are not compatible with current ARM
     processors or ABIs.

`.fnend'
     Marks the end of a function with an unwind table entry.  The
     unwind index table entry is created when this directive is
     processed.

     If no personality routine has been specified then standard
     personality routine 0 or 1 will be used, depending on the number
     of unwind opcodes required.

`.fnstart'
     Marks the start of a function with an unwind table entry.

`.force_thumb'
     This directive forces the selection of Thumb instructions, even if
     the target processor does not support those instructions

`.fpu NAME'
     Select the floating-point unit to assemble for.  Valid values for
     NAME are the same as for the `-mfpu' commandline option.

`.handlerdata'
     Marks the end of the current function, and the start of the
     exception table entry for that function.  Anything between this
     directive and the `.fnend' directive will be added to the
     exception table entry.

     Must be preceded by a `.personality' or `.personalityindex'
     directive.

`.inst OPCODE [ , ... ]'
`.inst.n OPCODE [ , ... ]'
`.inst.w OPCODE [ , ... ]'
     Generates the instruction corresponding to the numerical value
     OPCODE.  `.inst.n' and `.inst.w' allow the Thumb instruction size
     to be specified explicitly, overriding the normal encoding rules.

`.ldouble  EXPRESSION [, EXPRESSION]*'
     See `.extend'.

`.ltorg'
     This directive causes the current contents of the literal pool to
     be dumped into the current section (which is assumed to be the
     .text section) at the current location (aligned to a word
     boundary).  `GAS' maintains a separate literal pool for each
     section and each sub-section.  The `.ltorg' directive will only
     affect the literal pool of the current section and sub-section.
     At the end of assembly all remaining, un-empty literal pools will
     automatically be dumped.

     Note - older versions of `GAS' would dump the current literal pool
     any time a section change occurred.  This is no longer done, since
     it prevents accurate control of the placement of literal pools.

`.movsp REG [, #OFFSET]'
     Tell the unwinder that REG contains an offset from the current
     stack pointer.  If OFFSET is not specified then it is assumed to be
     zero.

`.object_arch NAME'
     Override the architecture recorded in the EABI object attribute
     section.  Valid values for NAME are the same as for the `.arch'
     directive.  Typically this is useful when code uses runtime
     detection of CPU features.

`.packed  EXPRESSION [, EXPRESSION]*'
     This directive writes 12-byte packed floating-point values to the
     output section.  These are not compatible with current ARM
     processors or ABIs.

`.pad #COUNT'
     Generate unwinder annotations for a stack adjustment of COUNT
     bytes.  A positive value indicates the function prologue allocated
     stack space by decrementing the stack pointer.

`.personality NAME'
     Sets the personality routine for the current function to NAME.

`.personalityindex INDEX'
     Sets the personality routine for the current function to the EABI
     standard routine number INDEX

`.pool'
     This is a synonym for .ltorg.

`NAME .req REGISTER NAME'
     This creates an alias for REGISTER NAME called NAME.  For example:

                  foo .req r0

`.save REGLIST'
     Generate unwinder annotations to restore the registers in REGLIST.
     The format of REGLIST is the same as the corresponding
     store-multiple instruction.

     _core registers_
            .save {r4, r5, r6, lr}
            stmfd sp!, {r4, r5, r6, lr}
     _FPA registers_
            .save f4, 2
            sfmfd f4, 2, [sp]!
     _VFP registers_
            .save {d8, d9, d10}
            fstmdx sp!, {d8, d9, d10}
     _iWMMXt registers_
            .save {wr10, wr11}
            wstrd wr11, [sp, #-8]!
            wstrd wr10, [sp, #-8]!
          or
            .save wr11
            wstrd wr11, [sp, #-8]!
            .save wr10
            wstrd wr10, [sp, #-8]!

`.setfp FPREG, SPREG [, #OFFSET]'
     Make all unwinder annotations relative to a frame pointer.
     Without this the unwinder will use offsets from the stack pointer.

     The syntax of this directive is the same as the `add' or `mov'
     instruction used to set the frame pointer.  SPREG must be either
     `sp' or mentioned in a previous `.movsp' directive.

          .movsp ip
          mov ip, sp
          ...
          .setfp fp, ip, #4
          add fp, ip, #4

`.secrel32 EXPRESSION [, EXPRESSION]*'
     This directive emits relocations that evaluate to the
     section-relative offset of each expression's symbol.  This
     directive is only supported for PE targets.

`.syntax [`unified' | `divided']'
     This directive sets the Instruction Set Syntax as described in the
     *Note ARM-Instruction-Set:: section.

`.thumb'
     This performs the same action as .CODE 16.

`.thumb_func'
     This directive specifies that the following symbol is the name of a
     Thumb encoded function.  This information is necessary in order to
     allow the assembler and linker to generate correct code for
     interworking between Arm and Thumb instructions and should be used
     even if interworking is not going to be performed.  The presence
     of this directive also implies `.thumb'

     This directive is not necessary when generating EABI objects.  On
     these targets the encoding is implicit when generating Thumb code.

`.thumb_set'
     This performs the equivalent of a `.set' directive in that it
     creates a symbol which is an alias for another symbol (possibly
     not yet defined).  This directive also has the added property in
     that it marks the aliased symbol as being a thumb function entry
     point, in the same way that the `.thumb_func' directive does.

`.tlsdescseq TLS-VARIABLE'
     This directive is used to annotate parts of an inlined TLS
     descriptor trampoline.  Normally the trampoline is provided by the
     linker, and this directive is not needed.

`.unreq ALIAS-NAME'
     This undefines a register alias which was previously defined using
     the `req', `dn' or `qn' directives.  For example:

                  foo .req r0
                  .unreq foo

     An error occurs if the name is undefined.  Note - this pseudo op
     can be used to delete builtin in register name aliases (eg 'r0').
     This should only be done if it is really necessary.

`.unwind_raw OFFSET, BYTE1, ...'
     Insert one of more arbitrary unwind opcode bytes, which are known
     to adjust the stack pointer by OFFSET bytes.

     For example `.unwind_raw 4, 0xb1, 0x01' is equivalent to `.save
     {r0}'

`.vsave VFP-REGLIST'
     Generate unwinder annotations to restore the VFP registers in
     VFP-REGLIST using FLDMD.  Also works for VFPv3 registers that are
     to be restored using VLDM.  The format of VFP-REGLIST is the same
     as the corresponding store-multiple instruction.

     _VFP registers_
            .vsave {d8, d9, d10}
            fstmdd sp!, {d8, d9, d10}
     _VFPv3 registers_
            .vsave {d15, d16, d17}
            vstm sp!, {d15, d16, d17}

     Since FLDMX and FSTMX are now deprecated, this directive should be
     used in favour of `.save' for saving VFP registers for ARMv6 and
     above.

9.4.5 Opcodes
-------------

`as' implements all the standard ARM opcodes.  It also implements
several pseudo opcodes, including several synthetic load instructions.

`NOP'
            nop

     This pseudo op will always evaluate to a legal ARM instruction
     that does nothing.  Currently it will evaluate to MOV r0, r0.

`LDR'
            ldr <register> , = <expression>

     If expression evaluates to a numeric constant then a MOV or MVN
     instruction will be used in place of the LDR instruction, if the
     constant can be generated by either of these instructions.
     Otherwise the constant will be placed into the nearest literal
     pool (if it not already there) and a PC relative LDR instruction
     will be generated.

`ADR'
            adr <register> <label>

     This instruction will load the address of LABEL into the indicated
     register.  The instruction will evaluate to a PC relative ADD or
     SUB instruction depending upon where the label is located.  If the
     label is out of range, or if it is not defined in the same file
     (and section) as the ADR instruction, then an error will be
     generated.  This instruction will not make use of the literal pool.

`ADRL'
            adrl <register> <label>

     This instruction will load the address of LABEL into the indicated
     register.  The instruction will evaluate to one or two PC relative
     ADD or SUB instructions depending upon where the label is located.
     If a second instruction is not needed a NOP instruction will be
     generated in its place, so that this instruction is always 8 bytes
     long.

     If the label is out of range, or if it is not defined in the same
     file (and section) as the ADRL instruction, then an error will be
     generated.  This instruction will not make use of the literal pool.

9.4.6 Mapping Symbols
---------------------

The ARM ELF specification requires that special symbols be inserted
into object files to mark certain features:

`$a'
     At the start of a region of code containing ARM instructions.

`$t'
     At the start of a region of code containing THUMB instructions.

`$d'
     At the start of a region of data.


   The assembler will automatically insert these symbols for you - there
is no need to code them yourself.  Support for tagging symbols ($b, $f,
$p and $m) which is also mentioned in the current ARM ELF specification
is not implemented.  This is because they have been dropped from the
new EABI and so tools cannot rely upon their presence.
