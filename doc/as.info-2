9.4.7 Unwinding
---------------

The ABI for the ARM Architecture specifies a standard format for
exception unwind information.  This information is used when an
exception is thrown to determine where control should be transferred.
In particular, the unwind information is used to determine which
function called the function that threw the exception, and which
function called that one, and so forth.  This information is also used
to restore the values of callee-saved registers in the function
catching the exception.

   If you are writing functions in assembly code, and those functions
call other functions that throw exceptions, you must use assembly
pseudo ops to ensure that appropriate exception unwind information is
generated.  Otherwise, if one of the functions called by your assembly
code throws an exception, the run-time library will be unable to unwind
the stack through your assembly code and your program will not behave
correctly.

   To illustrate the use of these pseudo ops, we will examine the code
that G++ generates for the following C++ input:


void callee (int *);

int
caller ()
{
  int i;
  callee (&i);
  return i;
}

   This example does not show how to throw or catch an exception from
assembly code.  That is a much more complex operation and should always
be done in a high-level language, such as C++, that directly supports
exceptions.

   The code generated by one particular version of G++ when compiling
the example above is:


_Z6callerv:
	.fnstart
.LFB2:
	@ Function supports interworking.
	@ args = 0, pretend = 0, frame = 8
	@ frame_needed = 1, uses_anonymous_args = 0
	stmfd	sp!, {fp, lr}
	.save {fp, lr}
.LCFI0:
	.setfp fp, sp, #4
	add	fp, sp, #4
.LCFI1:
	.pad #8
	sub	sp, sp, #8
.LCFI2:
	sub	r3, fp, #8
	mov	r0, r3
	bl	_Z6calleePi
	ldr	r3, [fp, #-8]
	mov	r0, r3
	sub	sp, fp, #4
	ldmfd	sp!, {fp, lr}
	bx	lr
.LFE2:
	.fnend

   Of course, the sequence of instructions varies based on the options
you pass to GCC and on the version of GCC in use.  The exact
instructions are not important since we are focusing on the pseudo ops
that are used to generate unwind information.

   An important assumption made by the unwinder is that the stack frame
does not change during the body of the function.  In particular, since
we assume that the assembly code does not itself throw an exception,
the only point where an exception can be thrown is from a call, such as
the `bl' instruction above.  At each call site, the same saved
registers (including `lr', which indicates the return address) must be
located in the same locations relative to the frame pointer.

   The `.fnstart' (*note .fnstart pseudo op: arm_fnstart.) pseudo op
appears immediately before the first instruction of the function while
the `.fnend' (*note .fnend pseudo op: arm_fnend.) pseudo op appears
immediately after the last instruction of the function.  These pseudo
ops specify the range of the function.

   Only the order of the other pseudos ops (e.g., `.setfp' or `.pad')
matters; their exact locations are irrelevant.  In the example above,
the compiler emits the pseudo ops with particular instructions.  That
makes it easier to understand the code, but it is not required for
correctness.  It would work just as well to emit all of the pseudo ops
other than `.fnend' in the same order, but immediately after `.fnstart'.

   The `.save' (*note .save pseudo op: arm_save.) pseudo op indicates
registers that have been saved to the stack so that they can be
restored before the function returns.  The argument to the `.save'
pseudo op is a list of registers to save.  If a register is
"callee-saved" (as specified by the ABI) and is modified by the
function you are writing, then your code must save the value before it
is modified and restore the original value before the function returns.
If an exception is thrown, the run-time library restores the values of
these registers from their locations on the stack before returning
control to the exception handler.  (Of course, if an exception is not
thrown, the function that contains the `.save' pseudo op restores these
registers in the function epilogue, as is done with the `ldmfd'
instruction above.)

   You do not have to save callee-saved registers at the very beginning
of the function and you do not need to use the `.save' pseudo op
immediately following the point at which the registers are saved.
However, if you modify a callee-saved register, you must save it on the
stack before modifying it and before calling any functions which might
throw an exception.  And, you must use the `.save' pseudo op to
indicate that you have done so.

   The `.pad' (*note .pad: arm_pad.) pseudo op indicates a modification
of the stack pointer that does not save any registers.  The argument is
the number of bytes (in decimal) that are subtracted from the stack
pointer.  (On ARM CPUs, the stack grows downwards, so subtracting from
the stack pointer increases the size of the stack.)

   The `.setfp' (*note .setfp pseudo op: arm_setfp.) pseudo op
indicates the register that contains the frame pointer.  The first
argument is the register that is set, which is typically `fp'.  The
second argument indicates the register from which the frame pointer
takes its value.  The third argument, if present, is the value (in
decimal) added to the register specified by the second argument to
compute the value of the frame pointer.  You should not modify the
frame pointer in the body of the function.

   If you do not use a frame pointer, then you should not use the
`.setfp' pseudo op.  If you do not use a frame pointer, then you should
avoid modifying the stack pointer outside of the function prologue.
Otherwise, the run-time library will be unable to find saved registers
when it is unwinding the stack.

   The pseudo ops described above are sufficient for writing assembly
code that calls functions which may throw exceptions.  If you need to
know more about the object-file format used to represent unwind
information, you may consult the `Exception Handling ABI for the ARM
Architecture' available from `http://infocenter.arm.com'.

..........................

The presence of a `;' anywhere on a line indicates the start of a
comment that extends to the end of that line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line, the whole line is
treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a logical
line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control
command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The `$' character can be used instead of a newline to separate
statements.

9.5.2.2 Register Names
......................

The AVR has 32 x 8-bit general purpose working registers `r0', `r1',
... `r31'.  Six of the 32 registers can be used as three 16-bit
indirect address register pointers for Data Space addressing. One of
the these address pointers can also be used as an address pointer for
look up tables in Flash program memory. These added function registers
are the 16-bit `X', `Y' and `Z' - registers.

     X = r26:r27
     Y = r28:r29
     Z = r30:r31

9.5.2.3 Relocatable Expression Modifiers
........................................

The assembler supports several modifiers when using relocatable
addresses in AVR instruction operands.  The general syntax is the
following:

     modifier(relocatable-expression)

`lo8'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 0 through 7 of an address
     expression as 8 bit relocatable expression.

`hi8'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 7 through 15 of an address
     expression as 8 bit relocatable expression.  This is useful with,
     for example, the AVR `ldi' instruction and `lo8' modifier.

     For example

          ldi r26, lo8(sym+10)
          ldi r27, hi8(sym+10)

`hh8'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 16 through 23 of an address
     expression as 8 bit relocatable expression.  Also, can be useful
     for loading 32 bit constants.

`hlo8'
     Synonym of `hh8'.

`hhi8'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 24 through 31 of an
     expression as 8 bit expression. This is useful with, for example,
     the AVR `ldi' instruction and `lo8', `hi8', `hlo8', `hhi8',
     modifier.

     For example

          ldi r26, lo8(285774925)
          ldi r27, hi8(285774925)
          ldi r28, hlo8(285774925)
          ldi r29, hhi8(285774925)
          ; r29,r28,r27,r26 = 285774925

`pm_lo8'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 0 through 7 of an address
     expression as 8 bit relocatable expression.  This modifier useful
     for addressing data or code from Flash/Program memory. The using
     of `pm_lo8' similar to `lo8'.

`pm_hi8'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 8 through 15 of an address
     expression as 8 bit relocatable expression.  This modifier useful
     for addressing data or code from Flash/Program memory.

`pm_hh8'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 15 through 23 of an address
     expression as 8 bit relocatable expression.  This modifier useful
     for addressing data or code from Flash/Program memory.

9.6.1 Options
-------------

`-mcpu=PROCESSOR[-SIREVISION]'
     This option specifies the target processor.  The optional
     SIREVISION is not used in assembler.  It's here such that GCC can
     easily pass down its `-mcpu=' option.  The assembler will issue an
     error message if an attempt is made to assemble an instruction
     which will not execute on the target processor.  The following
     processor names are recognized: `bf504', `bf506', `bf512', `bf514',
     `bf516', `bf518', `bf522', `bf523', `bf524', `bf525', `bf526',
     `bf527', `bf531', `bf532', `bf533', `bf534', `bf535' (not

9.6.2 Syntax
------------

`Special Characters'
     Assembler input is free format and may appear anywhere on the line.
     One instruction may extend across multiple lines or more than one
     instruction may appear on the same line.  White space (space, tab,
     comments or newline) may appear anywhere between tokens.  A token
     must not have embedded spaces.  Tokens include numbers, register
     names, keywords, user identifiers, and also some multicharacter
     special symbols like "+=", "/*" or "||".

     Comments are introduced by the `#' character and extend to the end
     of the current line.  If the `#' appears as the first character of
     a line, the whole line is treated as a comment, but in this case
     the line can also be a logical line number directive (*note
     Comments::) or a preprocessor control command (*note
     Preprocessing::).

`Instruction Delimiting'
     A semicolon must terminate every instruction.  Sometimes a complete
     instruction will consist of more than one operation.  There are two
     cases where this occurs.  The first is when two general operations
     are combined.  Normally a comma separates the different parts, as
     in

          a0= r3.h * r2.l, a1 = r3.l * r2.h ;

     The second case occurs when a general instruction is combined with
     one or two memory references for joint issue.  The latter portions
     are set off by a "||" token.

          a0 = r3.h * r2.l || r1 = [p3++] || r4 = [i2++];

     Multiple instructions can occur on the same line.  Each must be
     terminated by a semicolon character.

`Register Names'
     The assembler treats register names and instruction keywords in a
     case insensitive manner.  User identifiers are case sensitive.
     Thus, R3.l, R3.L, r3.l and r3.L are all equivalent input to the
     assembler.

     Register names are reserved and may not be used as program
     identifiers.

     Some operations (such as "Move Register") require a register pair.
     Register pairs are always data registers and are denoted using a
     colon, eg., R3:2.  The larger number must be written firsts.  Note
     that the hardware only supports odd-even pairs, eg., R7:6, R5:4,
     R3:2, and R1:0.

     Some instructions (such as -SP (Push Multiple)) require a group of
     adjacent registers.  Adjacent registers are denoted in the syntax
     by the range enclosed in parentheses and separated by a colon,
     eg., (R7:3).  Again, the larger number appears first.

     Portions of a particular register may be individually specified.
     This is written with a dot (".") following the register name and
     then a letter denoting the desired portion.  For 32-bit registers,
     ".H" denotes the most significant ("High") portion.  ".L" denotes
     the least-significant portion.  The subdivisions of the 40-bit
     registers are described later.

`Accumulators'
     The set of 40-bit registers A1 and A0 that normally contain data
     that is being manipulated.  Each accumulator can be accessed in
     four ways.

    `one 40-bit register'
          The register will be referred to as A1 or A0.

    `one 32-bit register'
          The registers are designated as A1.W or A0.W.

    `two 16-bit registers'
          The registers are designated as A1.H, A1.L, A0.H or A0.L.

    `one 8-bit register'
          The registers are designated as A1.X or A0.X for the bits that
          extend beyond bit 31.

`Data Registers'
     The set of 32-bit registers (R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 and R7)
     that normally contain data for manipulation.  These are
     abbreviated as D-register or Dreg.  Data registers can be accessed
     as 32-bit registers or as two independent 16-bit registers.  The
     least significant 16 bits of each register is called the "low"
     half and is designated with ".L" following the register name.  The
     most significant 16 bits are called the "high" half and is
     designated with ".H" following the name.

             R7.L, r2.h, r4.L, R0.H

`Pointer Registers'
     The set of 32-bit registers (P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, SP and FP)
     that normally contain byte addresses of data structures.  These are
     abbreviated as P-register or Preg.

          p2, p5, fp, sp

`Stack Pointer SP'
     The stack pointer contains the 32-bit address of the last occupied
     byte location in the stack.  The stack grows by decrementing the
     stack pointer.

`Frame Pointer FP'
     The frame pointer contains the 32-bit address of the previous frame
     pointer in the stack.  It is located at the top of a frame.

`Loop Top'
     LT0 and LT1.  These registers contain the 32-bit address of the
     top of a zero overhead loop.

`Loop Count'
     LC0 and LC1.  These registers contain the 32-bit counter of the
     zero overhead loop executions.

`Loop Bottom'
     LB0 and LB1.  These registers contain the 32-bit address of the
     bottom of a zero overhead loop.

`Index Registers'
     The set of 32-bit registers (I0, I1, I2, I3) that normally contain
     byte addresses of data structures.  Abbreviated I-register or Ireg.

`Modify Registers'
     The set of 32-bit registers (M0, M1, M2, M3) that normally contain
     offset values that are added and subtracted to one of the index
     registers.  Abbreviated as Mreg.

`Length Registers'
     The set of 32-bit registers (L0, L1, L2, L3) that normally contain
     the length in bytes of the circular buffer.  Abbreviated as Lreg.
     Clear the Lreg to disable circular addressing for the
     corresponding Ireg.

`Base Registers'
     The set of 32-bit registers (B0, B1, B2, B3) that normally contain
     the base address in bytes of the circular buffer.  Abbreviated as
     Breg.

`Floating Point'
     The Blackfin family has no hardware floating point but the .float
     directive generates ieee floating point numbers for use with
     software floating point libraries.

`Blackfin Opcodes'
     For detailed information on the Blackfin machine instruction set,
     see the Blackfin(r) Processor Instruction Set Reference.

9.7.1 CR16 Operand Qualifiers
-----------------------------

The National Semiconductor CR16 target of `as' has a few machine
dependent operand qualifiers.

   Operand expression type qualifier is an optional field in the
instruction operand, to determines the type of the expression field of
an operand. The `@' is required. CR16 architecture uses one of the
following expression qualifiers:

`s'
     - `Specifies expression operand type as small'

`m'
     - `Specifies expression operand type as medium'

`l'
     - `Specifies expression operand type as large'

`c'
     - `Specifies the CR16 Assembler generates a relocation entry for
     the operand, where pc has implied bit, the expression is adjusted
     accordingly. The linker uses the relocation entry to update the
     operand address at link time.'

`got/GOT'
     - `Specifies the CR16 Assembler generates a relocation entry for
     the operand, offset from Global Offset Table. The linker uses this
     relocation entry to update the operand address at link time'

`cgot/cGOT'
     - `Specifies the CompactRISC Assembler generates a relocation
     entry for the operand, where pc has implied bit, the expression is
     adjusted accordingly. The linker uses the relocation entry to
     update the operand address at link time.'

   CR16 target operand qualifiers and its size (in bits):

`Immediate Operand: s'
     4 bits.

`Immediate Operand: m'
     16 bits, for movb and movw instructions.

`Immediate Operand: m'
     20 bits, movd instructions.

`Immediate Operand: l'
     32 bits.

`Absolute Operand: s'
     Illegal specifier for this operand.

`Absolute Operand: m'
     20 bits, movd instructions.

`Displacement Operand: s'
     8 bits.

`Displacement Operand: m'
     16 bits.

`Displacement Operand: l'
     24 bits.


   For example:
     1   `movw $_myfun@c,r1'

         This loads the address of _myfun, shifted right by 1, into r1.

     2   `movd $_myfun@c,(r2,r1)'

         This loads the address of _myfun, shifted right by 1, into register-pair r2-r1.

     3   `_myfun_ptr:'
         `.long _myfun@c'
         `loadd _myfun_ptr, (r1,r0)'
         `jal (r1,r0)'

         This .long directive, the address of _myfunc, shifted right by 1 at link time.

     4   `loadd  _data1@GOT(r12), (r1,r0)'

         This loads the address of _data1, into global offset table (ie GOT) and its offset value from GOT loads into register-pair r2-r1.

     5   `loadd  _myfunc@cGOT(r12), (r1,r0)'

         This loads the address of _myfun, shifted right by 1, into global offset table (ie GOT) and its offset value from GOT loads into register-pair r1-r0.

(*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control command (*note
Preprocessing::).

   The `;' character can be used to separate statements on the same

File: as.info,  Node: CRIS-Opts,  Next: CRIS-Expand,  Up: CRIS-Dependent

9.8.1 Command-line Options
--------------------------

The CRIS version of `as' has these machine-dependent command-line
options.

   The format of the generated object files can be either ELF or a.out,
specified by the command-line options `--emulation=crisaout' and
`--emulation=criself'.  The default is ELF (criself), unless `as' has
been configured specifically for a.out by using the configuration name
`cris-axis-aout'.

   There are two different link-incompatible ELF object file variants
for CRIS, for use in environments where symbols are expected to be
prefixed by a leading `_' character and for environments without such a
symbol prefix.  The variant used for GNU/Linux port has no symbol
prefix.  Which variant to produce is specified by either of the options
`--underscore' and `--no-underscore'.  The default is `--underscore'.
Since symbols in CRIS a.out objects are expected to have a `_' prefix,
specifying `--no-underscore' when generating a.out objects is an error.
Besides the object format difference, the effect of this option is to
parse register names differently (*note crisnous::).  The
`--no-underscore' option makes a `$' register prefix mandatory.

   The option `--pic' must be passed to `as' in order to recognize the
symbol syntax used for ELF (SVR4 PIC) position-independent-code (*note
crispic::).  This will also affect expansion of instructions.  The
expansion with `--pic' will use PC-relative rather than (slightly
faster) absolute addresses in those expansions.  This option is only
valid when generating ELF format object files.

   The option `--march=ARCHITECTURE' specifies the recognized
instruction set and recognized register names.  It also controls the
architecture type of the object file.  Valid values for ARCHITECTURE
are:
`v0_v10'
     All instructions and register names for any architecture variant
     in the set v0...v10 are recognized.  This is the default if the
     target is configured as cris-*.

`v10'
     Only instructions and register names for CRIS v10 (as found in
     ETRAX 100 LX) are recognized.  This is the default if the target
     is configured as crisv10-*.

`v32'
     Only instructions and register names for CRIS v32 (code name
     Guinness) are recognized.  This is the default if the target is
     configured as crisv32-*.  This value implies `--no-mul-bug-abort'.
     (A subsequent `--mul-bug-abort' will turn it back on.)

`common_v10_v32'
     Only instructions with register names and addressing modes with
     opcodes common to the v10 and v32 are recognized.

   When `-N' is specified, `as' will emit a warning when a 16-bit
branch instruction is expanded into a 32-bit multiple-instruction
construct (*note CRIS-Expand::).

   Some versions of the CRIS v10, for example in the Etrax 100 LX,
contain a bug that causes destabilizing memory accesses when a multiply
instruction is executed with certain values in the first operand just
before a cache-miss.  When the `--mul-bug-abort' command line option is
active (the default value), `as' will refuse to assemble a file
containing a multiply instruction at a dangerous offset, one that could
be the last on a cache-line, or is in a section with insufficient
alignment.  This placement checking does not catch any case where the
multiply instruction is dangerously placed because it is located in a
delay-slot.  The `--mul-bug-abort' command line option turns off the
checking.


File: as.info,  Node: CRIS-Expand,  Next: CRIS-Symbols,  Prev: CRIS-Opts,  Up: CRIS-Dependent

9.8.2 Instruction expansion
---------------------------

`as' will silently choose an instruction that fits the operand size for
`[register+constant]' operands.  For example, the offset `127' in
`move.d [r3+127],r4' fits in an instruction using a signed-byte offset.
Similarly, `move.d [r2+32767],r1' will generate an instruction using a
16-bit offset.  For symbolic expressions and constants that do not fit
in 16 bits including the sign bit, a 32-bit offset is generated.

   For branches, `as' will expand from a 16-bit branch instruction into
a sequence of instructions that can reach a full 32-bit address.  Since
this does not correspond to a single instruction, such expansions can
optionally be warned about.  *Note CRIS-Opts::.

   If the operand is found to fit the range, a `lapc' mnemonic will
translate to a `lapcq' instruction.  Use `lapc.d' to force the 32-bit
`lapc' instruction.

   Similarly, the `addo' mnemonic will translate to the shortest
fitting instruction of `addoq', `addo.w' and `addo.d', when used with a
operand that is a constant known at assembly time.

9.8.3 Symbols
-------------

Some symbols are defined by the assembler.  They're intended to be used
in conditional assembly, for example:
      .if ..asm.arch.cris.v32
      CODE FOR CRIS V32
      .elseif ..asm.arch.cris.common_v10_v32
      CODE COMMON TO CRIS V32 AND CRIS V10
      .elseif ..asm.arch.cris.v10 | ..asm.arch.cris.any_v0_v10
      CODE FOR V10
      .else
      .error "Code needs to be added here."
      .endif

   These symbols are defined in the assembler, reflecting command-line
options, either when specified or the default.  They are always
defined, to 0 or 1.
`..asm.arch.cris.any_v0_v10'
     This symbol is non-zero when `--march=v0_v10' is specified or the
     default.

`..asm.arch.cris.common_v10_v32'
     Set according to the option `--march=common_v10_v32'.

`..asm.arch.cris.v10'

`..asm.arch.cris.v32'
     Corresponds to `--march=v10'.

   Speaking of symbols, when a symbol is used in code, it can have a
suffix modifying its value for use in position-independent code. *Note

9.8.4.1 Special Characters
..........................

The character `#' is a line comment character.  It starts a comment if
and only if it is placed at the beginning of a line.

   A `;' character starts a comment anywhere on the line, causing all
characters up to the end of the line to be ignored.

   A `@' character is handled as a line separator equivalent to a
logical new-line character (except in a comment), so separate
instructions can be specified on a single line.

9.8.4.2 Symbols in position-independent code
............................................

When generating position-independent code (SVR4 PIC) for use in
cris-axis-linux-gnu or crisv32-axis-linux-gnu shared libraries, symbol
suffixes are used to specify what kind of run-time symbol lookup will
be used, expressed in the object as different _relocation types_.
Usually, all absolute symbol values must be located in a table, the
_global offset table_, leaving the code position-independent;
independent of values of global symbols and independent of the address
of the code.  The suffix modifies the value of the symbol, into for
example an index into the global offset table where the real symbol
value is entered, or a PC-relative value, or a value relative to the
start of the global offset table.  All symbol suffixes start with the
character `:' (omitted in the list below).  Every symbol use in code or
a read-only section must therefore have a PIC suffix to enable a useful
shared library to be created.  Usually, these constructs must not be
used with an additive constant offset as is usually allowed, i.e. no 4
as in `symbol + 4' is allowed.  This restriction is checked at
link-time, not at assembly-time.

`GOT'
     Attaching this suffix to a symbol in an instruction causes the
     symbol to be entered into the global offset table.  The value is a
     32-bit index for that symbol into the global offset table.  The
     name of the corresponding relocation is `R_CRIS_32_GOT'.  Example:
     `move.d [$r0+extsym:GOT],$r9'

`GOT16'
     Same as for `GOT', but the value is a 16-bit index into the global
     offset table.  The corresponding relocation is `R_CRIS_16_GOT'.
     Example: `move.d [$r0+asymbol:GOT16],$r10'

`PLT'
     This suffix is used for function symbols.  It causes a _procedure
     linkage table_, an array of code stubs, to be created at the time
     the shared object is created or linked against, together with a
     global offset table entry.  The value is a pc-relative offset to
     the corresponding stub code in the procedure linkage table.  This
     arrangement causes the run-time symbol resolver to be called to
     look up and set the value of the symbol the first time the
     function is called (at latest; depending environment variables).
     It is only safe to leave the symbol unresolved this way if all
     references are function calls.  The name of the relocation is
     `R_CRIS_32_PLT_PCREL'.  Example: `add.d fnname:PLT,$pc'

`PLTG'
     Like PLT, but the value is relative to the beginning of the global
     offset table.  The relocation is `R_CRIS_32_PLT_GOTREL'.  Example:
     `move.d fnname:PLTG,$r3'

`GOTPLT'
     Similar to `PLT', but the value of the symbol is a 32-bit index
     into the global offset table.  This is somewhat of a mix between
     the effect of the `GOT' and the `PLT' suffix; the difference to
     `GOT' is that there will be a procedure linkage table entry
     created, and that the symbol is assumed to be a function entry and
     will be resolved by the run-time resolver as with `PLT'.  The
     relocation is `R_CRIS_32_GOTPLT'.  Example: `jsr
     [$r0+fnname:GOTPLT]'

`GOTPLT16'
     A variant of `GOTPLT' giving a 16-bit value.  Its relocation name
     is `R_CRIS_16_GOTPLT'.  Example: `jsr [$r0+fnname:GOTPLT16]'

`GOTOFF'
     This suffix must only be attached to a local symbol, but may be
     used in an expression adding an offset.  The value is the address
     of the symbol relative to the start of the global offset table.
     The relocation name is `R_CRIS_32_GOTREL'.  Example: `move.d
     [$r0+localsym:GOTOFF],r3'

9.8.4.3 Register names
......................

A `$' character may always prefix a general or special register name in
an instruction operand but is mandatory when the option
`--no-underscore' is specified or when the `.syntax register_prefix'
directive is in effect (*note crisnous::).  Register names are
case-insensitive.


File: as.info,  Node: CRIS-Pseudos,  Prev: CRIS-Regs,  Up: CRIS-Syntax

9.8.4.4 Assembler Directives
............................

There are a few CRIS-specific pseudo-directives in addition to the
generic ones.  *Note Pseudo Ops::.  Constants emitted by
pseudo-directives are in little-endian order for CRIS.  There is no
support for floating-point-specific directives for CRIS.

`.dword EXPRESSIONS'
     The `.dword' directive is a synonym for `.int', expecting zero or
     more EXPRESSIONS, separated by commas.  For each expression, a
     32-bit little-endian constant is emitted.

`.syntax ARGUMENT'
     The `.syntax' directive takes as ARGUMENT one of the following
     case-sensitive choices.

    `no_register_prefix'
          The `.syntax no_register_prefix' directive makes a `$'
          character prefix on all registers optional.  It overrides a
          previous setting, including the corresponding effect of the
          option `--no-underscore'.  If this directive is used when
          ordinary symbols do not have a `_' character prefix, care
          must be taken to avoid ambiguities whether an operand is a
          register or a symbol; using symbols with names the same as
          general or special registers then invoke undefined behavior.

    `register_prefix'
          This directive makes a `$' character prefix on all registers
          mandatory.  It overrides a previous setting, including the
          corresponding effect of the option `--underscore'.

    `leading_underscore'
          This is an assertion directive, emitting an error if the
          `--no-underscore' option is in effect.

    `no_leading_underscore'
          This is the opposite of the `.syntax leading_underscore'
          directive and emits an error if the option `--underscore' is
          in effect.

`.arch ARGUMENT'
     This is an assertion directive, giving an error if the specified
     ARGUMENT is not the same as the specified or default value for the
     `--march=ARCHITECTURE' option (*note march-option::).

9.9.1 D10V Options
------------------

The Mitsubishi D10V version of `as' has a few machine dependent options.

`-O'
     The D10V can often execute two sub-instructions in parallel. When
     this option is used, `as' will attempt to optimize its output by
     detecting when instructions can be executed in parallel.

`--nowarnswap'
     To optimize execution performance, `as' will sometimes swap the
     order of instructions. Normally this generates a warning. When
     this option is used, no warning will be generated when
     instructions are swapped.

`--gstabs-packing'
`--no-gstabs-packing'
     `as' packs adjacent short instructions into a single packed
     instruction. `--no-gstabs-packing' turns instruction packing off if
     `--gstabs' is specified as well; `--gstabs-packing' (the default)
     turns instruction packing on even when `--gstabs' is specified.

9.9.2 Syntax

File: as.info,  Node: D10V-Size,  Next: D10V-Subs,  Up: D10V-Syntax

9.9.2.1 Size Modifiers
......................

The D10V version of `as' uses the instruction names in the D10V
Architecture Manual.  However, the names in the manual are sometimes
ambiguous.  There are instruction names that can assemble to a short or
long form opcode.  How does the assembler pick the correct form?  `as'
will always pick the smallest form if it can.  When dealing with a
symbol that is not defined yet when a line is being assembled, it will
always use the long form.  If you need to force the assembler to use
either the short or long form of the instruction, you can append either
`.s' (short) or `.l' (long) to it.  For example, if you are writing an
assembly program and you want to do a branch to a symbol that is
defined later in your program, you can write `bra.s   foo'.  Objdump
and GDB will always append `.s' or `.l' to instructions which have both
short and long forms.

9.9.2.2 Sub-Instructions
........................

The D10V assembler takes as input a series of instructions, either
one-per-line, or in the special two-per-line format described in the
next section.  Some of these instructions will be short-form or
sub-instructions.  These sub-instructions can be packed into a single
instruction.  The assembler will do this automatically.  It will also
detect when it should not pack instructions.  For example, when a label
is defined, the next instruction will never be packaged with the
previous one.  Whenever a branch and link instruction is called, it
will not be packaged with the next instruction so the return address
will be valid.  Nops are automatically inserted when necessary.

   If you do not want the assembler automatically making these
decisions, you can control the packaging and execution type (parallel
or sequential) with the special execution symbols described in the next
section.


File: as.info,  Node: D10V-Chars,  Next: D10V-Regs,  Prev: D10V-Subs,  Up: D10V-Syntax

9.9.2.3 Special Characters
..........................

A semicolon (`;') can be used anywhere on a line to start a comment
that extends to the end of the line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line, the whole line is
treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be a logical
line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control
command (*note Preprocessing::).

   Sub-instructions may be executed in order, in reverse-order, or in
parallel.  Instructions listed in the standard one-per-line format will
be executed sequentially.  To specify the executing order, use the
following symbols:
`->'
     Sequential with instruction on the left first.

`<-'
     Sequential with instruction on the right first.

`||'
     Parallel
   The D10V syntax allows either one instruction per line, one
instruction per line with the execution symbol, or two instructions per
line.  For example
`abs       a1      ->      abs     r0'
     Execute these sequentially.  The instruction on the right is in
     the right container and is executed second.

`abs       r0      <-      abs     a1'
     Execute these reverse-sequentially.  The instruction on the right
     is in the right container, and is executed first.

`ld2w    r2,@r8+         ||      mac     a0,r0,r7'
     Execute these in parallel.

`ld2w    r2,@r8+         ||'
`mac     a0,r0,r7'
     Two-line format. Execute these in parallel.

`ld2w    r2,@r8+'
`mac     a0,r0,r7'
     Two-line format. Execute these sequentially.  Assembler will put
     them in the proper containers.

`ld2w    r2,@r8+         ->'
`mac     a0,r0,r7'
     Two-line format. Execute these sequentially.  Same as above but
     second instruction will always go into right container.
   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

9.9.2.4 Register Names
......................

You can use the predefined symbols `r0' through `r15' to refer to the
D10V registers.  You can also use `sp' as an alias for `r15'.  The
accumulators are `a0' and `a1'.  There are special register-pair names
that may optionally be used in opcodes that require even-numbered
registers. Register names are not case sensitive.

   Register Pairs
`r0-r1'

`r2-r3'

`r4-r5'

`r6-r7'

`r8-r9'

`r10-r11'

`r12-r13'

`r14-r15'

   The D10V also has predefined symbols for these control registers and
status bits:
`psw'

`bpsw'
     Backup Processor Status Word

`pc'
     Program Counter

`bpc'

`as' understands the following addressing modes for the D10V.  `RN' in
the following refers to any of the numbered registers, but _not_ the
control registers.
`RN'
     Register direct

`@RN'
     Register indirect

`@RN+'
     Register indirect with post-increment

`@RN-'
     Register indirect with post-decrement

`@-SP'
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

`@(DISP, RN)'
     Register indirect with displacement

`ADDR'
     PC relative address (for branch or rep).

9.9.2.6 @WORD Modifier
......................

Any symbol followed by `@word' will be replaced by the symbol's value
shifted right by 2.  This is used in situations such as loading a
register with the address of a function (or any other code fragment).
For example, if you want to load a register with the location of the
function `main' then jump to that function, you could do it as follows:
     ldi     r2, main@word

A semicolon (`;') can be used anywhere on a line to start a comment
that extends to the end of the line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line, the whole line is
treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be a logical
line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control
command (*note Preprocessing::).

   Sub-instructions may be executed in order, in reverse-order, or in

be executed sequentially unless you use the `-O' option.

   To specify the executing order, use the following symbols:
`->'
     Sequential with instruction on the left first.

`<-'
     Sequential with instruction on the right first.

`||'
     Parallel

   The D30V syntax allows either one instruction per line, one
instruction per line with the execution symbol, or two instructions per
line.  For example
`abs r2,r3 -> abs r4,r5'
     Execute these sequentially.  The instruction on the right is in
     the right container and is executed second.

`abs r2,r3 <- abs r4,r5'
     Execute these reverse-sequentially.  The instruction on the right
     is in the right container, and is executed first.

`abs r2,r3 || abs r4,r5'
     Execute these in parallel.

`ldw r2,@(r3,r4) ||'
`mulx r6,r8,r9'
     Two-line format. Execute these in parallel.

`mulx a0,r8,r9'
`stw r2,@(r3,r4)'
     Two-line format. Execute these sequentially unless `-O' option is
     used.  If the `-O' option is used, the assembler will determine if
     the instructions could be done in parallel (the above two
     instructions can be done in parallel), and if so, emit them as
     parallel instructions.  The assembler will put them in the proper
     containers.  In the above example, the assembler will put the
     `stw' instruction in left container and the `mulx' instruction in
     the right container.

`stw r2,@(r3,r4) ->'
`mulx a0,r8,r9'
     Two-line format.  Execute the `stw' instruction followed by the
     `mulx' instruction sequentially.  The first instruction goes in the
     left container and the second instruction goes into right
     container.  The assembler will give an error if the machine
     ordering constraints are violated.

`stw r2,@(r3,r4) <-'
`mulx a0,r8,r9'
     Same as previous example, except that the `mulx' instruction is
     executed before the `stw' instruction.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

9.10.2.6 Addressing Modes
.........................

`as' understands the following addressing modes for the D30V.  `RN' in
the following refers to any of the numbered registers, but _not_ the
control registers.
`RN'
     Register direct

`@RN'
     Register indirect

`@RN+'
     Register indirect with post-increment

`@RN-'
     Register indirect with post-decrement

`@-SP'
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

`@(DISP, RN)'
     Register indirect with displacement

`ADDR'
     PC relative address (for branch or rep).

`#IMM'
     Immediate data (the `#' is optional and ignored)

9.10.3 Floating Point
---------------------

The D30V has no hardware floating point, but the `.float' and `.double'
directives generates IEEE floating-point numbers for compatibility with
other development tools.

9.10.4 Opcodes
--------------

For detailed information on the D30V machine instruction set, see `D30V
Architecture: A VLIW Microprocessor for Multimedia Applications'
(Mitsubishi Electric Corp.).  `as' implements all the standard D30V
opcodes.  The only changes are those described in the section on size
modifiers

9.11.1 Options
--------------

`as' has two additional command-line options for the Epiphany
architecture.

`-mepiphany'
     Specifies that the both 32 and 16 bit instructions are allowed.
     This is the default behavior.

`-mepiphany16'
     Restricts the permitted instructions to just the 16 bit set.

9.11.2.1 Special Characters
...........................

The presence of a `;' on a line indicates the start of a comment that
extends to the end of the current line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The ``' character can be used to separate statements on the same
line.

The Renesas H8/300 version of `as' has one machine-dependent option:

`-h-tick-hex'
     Support H'00 style hex constants in addition to 0x00 style.

`-mach=NAME'
     Sets the H8300 machine variant.  The following machine names are
     recognised: `h8300h', `h8300hn', `h8300s', `h8300sn', `h8300sx' and
     `h8300sxn'.

9.12.2.1 Special Characters
...........................

`;' is the line comment character.

   `$' can be used instead of a newline to separate statements.
Therefore _you may not use `$' in symbol names_ on the H8/300.

9.12.2.2 Register Names
.......................

You can use predefined symbols of the form `rNh' and `rNl' to refer to
the H8/300 registers as sixteen 8-bit general-purpose registers.  N is
a digit from `0' to `7'); for instance, both `r0h' and `r7l' are valid
register names.

   You can also use the eight predefined symbols `rN' to refer to the
H8/300 registers as 16-bit registers (you must use this form for
addressing).

   On the H8/300H, you can also use the eight predefined symbols `erN'
(`er0' ... `er7') to refer to the 32-bit general purpose registers.

   The two control registers are called `pc' (program counter; a 16-bit
register, except on the H8/300H where it is 24 bits) and `ccr'
(condition code register; an 8-bit register).  `r7' is used as the
stack pointer, and can also be called `sp'.

9.12.2.3 Addressing Modes
.........................

as understands the following addressing modes for the H8/300:
`rN'
     Register direct

`@rN'
     Register indirect

`@(D, rN)'
`@(D:16, rN)'
`@(D:24, rN)'
     Register indirect: 16-bit or 24-bit displacement D from register
     N.  (24-bit displacements are only meaningful on the H8/300H.)

`@rN+'
     Register indirect with post-increment

`@-rN'
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

``@'AA'
``@'AA:8'
``@'AA:16'
``@'AA:24'
     Absolute address `aa'.  (The address size `:24' only makes sense
     on the H8/300H.)

`#XX'
`#XX:8'
`#XX:16'
`#XX:32'
     Immediate data XX.  You may specify the `:8', `:16', or `:32' for
     clarity, if you wish; but `as' neither requires this nor uses
     it--the data size required is taken from context.

``@'`@'AA'
``@'`@'AA:8'
     Memory indirect.  You may specify the `:8' for clarity, if you
     wish; but `as' neither requires this nor uses it.

9.12.4 H8/300 Machine Directives
--------------------------------

`as' has the following machine-dependent directives for the H8/300:

`.h8300h'
     Recognize and emit additional instructions for the H8/300H
     variant, and also make `.int' emit 32-bit numbers rather than the
     usual (16-bit) for the H8/300 family.

`.h8300s'
     Recognize and emit additional instructions for the H8S variant, and
     also make `.int' emit 32-bit numbers rather than the usual (16-bit)
     for the H8/300 family.

`.h8300hn'
     Recognize and emit additional instructions for the H8/300H variant
     in normal mode, and also make `.int' emit 32-bit numbers rather
     than the usual (16-bit) for the H8/300 family.

`.h8300sn'
     Recognize and emit additional instructions for the H8S variant in
     normal mode, and also make `.int' emit 32-bit numbers rather than
     the usual (16-bit) for the H8/300 family.

   On the H8/300 family (including the H8/300H) `.word' directives
generate 16-bit numbers.

`H8/300 Series Programming Manual'.  For information specific to the
H8/300H, see `H8/300H Series Programming Manual' (Renesas).

   Four H8/300 instructions (`add', `cmp', `mov', `sub') are defined
with variants using the suffixes `.b', `.w', and `.l' to specify the
size of a memory operand.  `as' supports these suffixes, but does not
require them; since one of the operands is always a register, `as' can
deduce the correct size.

   For example, since `r0' refers to a 16-bit register,
     mov    r0,@foo
is equivalent to
     mov.w  r0,@foo

   If you use the size suffixes, `as' issues a warning when the suffix
and the register size do not match.

9.13.1 Notes
------------

As a back end for GNU CC `as' has been thoroughly tested and should
work extremely well.  We have tested it only minimally on hand written
assembly code and no one has tested it much on the assembly output from
the HP compilers.

   The format of the debugging sections has changed since the original
`as' port (version 1.3X) was released; therefore, you must rebuild all
HPPA objects and libraries with the new assembler so that you can debug
the final executable.

   The HPPA `as' port generates a small subset of the relocations
available in the SOM and ELF object file formats.  Additional relocation
support will be added as it becomes necessary.

File: as.info,  Node: HPPA Syntax,  Next: HPPA Floating Point,  Prev: HPPA Options,  Up: HPPA-Dependent

9.13.3 Syntax
-------------

The assembler syntax closely follows the HPPA instruction set reference
manual; assembler directives and general syntax closely follow the HPPA
assembly language reference manual, with a few noteworthy differences.

   First, a colon may immediately follow a label definition.  This is
simply for compatibility with how most assembly language programmers
write code.

   Some obscure expression parsing problems may affect hand written
code which uses the `spop' instructions, or code which makes significant
use of the `!' line separator.

   `as' is much less forgiving about missing arguments and other
similar oversights than the HP assembler.  `as' notifies you of missing
arguments as syntax errors; this is regarded as a feature, not a bug.

   Finally, `as' allows you to use an external symbol without
explicitly importing the symbol.  _Warning:_ in the future this will be
an error for HPPA targets.

   Special characters for HPPA targets include:

   `;' is the line comment character.

   `!' can be used instead of a newline to separate statements.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

9.13.5 HPPA Assembler Directives
--------------------------------

`as' for the HPPA supports many additional directives for compatibility
with the native assembler.  This section describes them only briefly.
For detailed information on HPPA-specific assembler directives, see
`HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language Reference Manual' (HP 92432-90001).

   `as' does _not_ support the following assembler directives described
in the HP manual:

     .endm           .liston
     .enter          .locct
     .leave          .macro
     .listoff

   Beyond those implemented for compatibility, `as' supports one
additional assembler directive for the HPPA: `.param'.  It conveys
register argument locations for static functions.  Its syntax closely
follows the `.export' directive.

   These are the additional directives in `as' for the HPPA:

`.block N'
`.blockz N'
     Reserve N bytes of storage, and initialize them to zero.

`.call'
     Mark the beginning of a procedure call.  Only the special case
     with _no arguments_ is allowed.

`.callinfo [ PARAM=VALUE, ... ]  [ FLAG, ... ]'
     Specify a number of parameters and flags that define the
     environment for a procedure.

     PARAM may be any of `frame' (frame size), `entry_gr' (end of
     general register range), `entry_fr' (end of float register range),
     `entry_sr' (end of space register range).

     The values for FLAG are `calls' or `caller' (proc has
     subroutines), `no_calls' (proc does not call subroutines),
     `save_rp' (preserve return pointer), `save_sp' (proc preserves
     stack pointer), `no_unwind' (do not unwind this proc), `hpux_int'
     (proc is interrupt routine).

`.code'
     Assemble into the standard section called `$TEXT$', subsection
     `$CODE$'.

`.copyright "STRING"'
     In the SOM object format, insert STRING into the object code,
     marked as a copyright string.

`.copyright "STRING"'
     In the ELF object format, insert STRING into the object code,
     marked as a version string.

`.enter'
     Not yet supported; the assembler rejects programs containing this
     directive.

`.entry'
     Mark the beginning of a procedure.

`.exit'
     Mark the end of a procedure.

`.export NAME [ ,TYP ]  [ ,PARAM=R ]'
     Make a procedure NAME available to callers.  TYP, if present, must
     be one of `absolute', `code' (ELF only, not SOM), `data', `entry',
     `data', `entry', `millicode', `plabel', `pri_prog', or `sec_prog'.

     PARAM, if present, provides either relocation information for the
     procedure arguments and result, or a privilege level.  PARAM may be
     `argwN' (where N ranges from `0' to `3', and indicates one of four
     one-word arguments); `rtnval' (the procedure's result); or
     `priv_lev' (privilege level).  For arguments or the result, R
     specifies how to relocate, and must be one of `no' (not
     relocatable), `gr' (argument is in general register), `fr' (in
     floating point register), or `fu' (upper half of float register).
     For `priv_lev', R is an integer.

`.half N'
     Define a two-byte integer constant N; synonym for the portable
     `as' directive `.short'.

`.import NAME [ ,TYP ]'
     Converse of `.export'; make a procedure available to call.  The
     arguments use the same conventions as the first two arguments for
     `.export'.

`.label NAME'
     Define NAME as a label for the current assembly location.

`.leave'
     Not yet supported; the assembler rejects programs containing this
     directive.

`.origin LC'
     Advance location counter to LC. Synonym for the `as' portable
     directive `.org'.

`.param NAME [ ,TYP ]  [ ,PARAM=R ]'
     Similar to `.export', but used for static procedures.

`.proc'
     Use preceding the first statement of a procedure.

`.procend'
     Use following the last statement of a procedure.

`LABEL .reg EXPR'
     Synonym for `.equ'; define LABEL with the absolute expression EXPR
     as its value.

`.space SECNAME [ ,PARAMS ]'
     Switch to section SECNAME, creating a new section by that name if
     necessary.  You may only use PARAMS when creating a new section,
     not when switching to an existing one.  SECNAME may identify a
     section by number rather than by name.

     If specified, the list PARAMS declares attributes of the section,
     identified by keywords.  The keywords recognized are `spnum=EXP'
     (identify this section by the number EXP, an absolute expression),
     `sort=EXP' (order sections according to this sort key when linking;
     EXP is an absolute expression), `unloadable' (section contains no
     loadable data), `notdefined' (this section defined elsewhere), and
     `private' (data in this section not available to other programs).

`.spnum SECNAM'
     Allocate four bytes of storage, and initialize them with the
     section number of the section named SECNAM.  (You can define the
     section number with the HPPA `.space' directive.)

`.string "STR"'
     Copy the characters in the string STR to the object file.  *Note
     Strings: Strings, for information on escape sequences you can use
     in `as' strings.

     _Warning!_ The HPPA version of `.string' differs from the usual
     `as' definition: it does _not_ write a zero byte after copying STR.

`.stringz "STR"'
     Like `.string', but appends a zero byte after copying STR to object
     file.

`.subspa NAME [ ,PARAMS ]'
`.nsubspa NAME [ ,PARAMS ]'
     Similar to `.space', but selects a subsection NAME within the
     current section.  You may only specify PARAMS when you create a
     subsection (in the first instance of `.subspa' for this NAME).

     If specified, the list PARAMS declares attributes of the
     subsection, identified by keywords.  The keywords recognized are
     `quad=EXPR' ("quadrant" for this subsection), `align=EXPR'
     (alignment for beginning of this subsection; a power of two),
     `access=EXPR' (value for "access rights" field), `sort=EXPR'
     (sorting order for this subspace in link), `code_only' (subsection
     contains only code), `unloadable' (subsection cannot be loaded
     into memory), `comdat' (subsection is comdat), `common'
     (subsection is common block), `dup_comm' (subsection may have
     duplicate names), or `zero' (subsection is all zeros, do not write
     in object file).

     `.nsubspa' always creates a new subspace with the given name, even
     if one with the same name already exists.

     `comdat', `common' and `dup_comm' can be used to implement various
     flavors of one-only support when using the SOM linker.  The SOM
     linker only supports specific combinations of these flags.  The
     details are not documented.  A brief description is provided here.

     `comdat' provides a form of linkonce support.  It is useful for
     both code and data subspaces.  A `comdat' subspace has a key symbol
     marked by the `is_comdat' flag or `ST_COMDAT'.  Only the first
     subspace for any given key is selected.  The key symbol becomes
     universal in shared links.  This is similar to the behavior of
     `secondary_def' symbols.

     `common' provides Fortran named common support.  It is only useful
     for data subspaces.  Symbols with the flag `is_common' retain this
     flag in shared links.  Referencing a `is_common' symbol in a shared
     library from outside the library doesn't work.  Thus, `is_common'
     symbols must be output whenever they are needed.

     `common' and `dup_comm' together provide Cobol common support.
     The subspaces in this case must all be the same length.
     Otherwise, this support is similar to the Fortran common support.

     `dup_comm' by itself provides a type of one-only support for code.
     Only the first `dup_comm' subspace is selected.  There is a rather
     complex algorithm to compare subspaces.  Code symbols marked with
     the `dup_common' flag are hidden.  This support was intended for
     "C++ duplicate inlines".

     A simplified technique is used to mark the flags of symbols based
     on the flags of their subspace.  A symbol with the scope
     SS_UNIVERSAL and type ST_ENTRY, ST_CODE or ST_DATA is marked with
     the corresponding settings of `comdat', `common' and `dup_comm'
     from the subspace, respectively.  This avoids having to introduce
     additional directives to mark these symbols.  The HP assembler
     sets `is_common' from `common'.  However, it doesn't set the
     `dup_common' from `dup_comm'.  It doesn't have `comdat' support.

`.version "STR"'
     Write STR as version identifier in object code.

9.14.1 Notes
------------

The ESA/390 `as' port is currently intended to be a back-end for the
GNU CC compiler.  It is not HLASM compatible, although it does support
a subset of some of the HLASM directives.  The only supported binary
file format is ELF; none of the usual MVS/VM/OE/USS object file
formats, such as ESD or XSD, are supported.

   When used with the GNU CC compiler, the ESA/390 `as' will produce
correct, fully relocated, functional binaries, and has been used to
compile and execute large projects.  However, many aspects should still
be considered experimental; these include shared library support,
dynamically loadable objects, and any relocation other than the 31-bit
relocation.

File: as.info,  Node: ESA/390 Syntax,  Next: ESA/390 Floating Point,  Prev: ESA/390 Options,  Up: ESA/390-Dependent

9.14.3 Syntax
-------------

The opcode/operand syntax follows the ESA/390 Principles of Operation
manual; assembler directives and general syntax are loosely based on the
prevailing AT&T/SVR4/ELF/Solaris style notation.  HLASM-style directives
are _not_ supported for the most part, with the exception of those
described herein.

   A leading dot in front of directives is optional, and the case of
directives is ignored; thus for example, .using and USING have the same
effect.

   A colon may immediately follow a label definition.  This is simply
for compatibility with how most assembly language programmers write
code.

   `#' is the line comment character.

   `;' can be used instead of a newline to separate statements.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

   Registers can be given the symbolic names r0..r15, fp0, fp2, fp4,
fp6.  By using these symbolic names, `as' can detect simple syntax
errors. The name rarg or r.arg is a synonym for r11, rtca or r.tca for
r12, sp, r.sp, dsa r.dsa for r13, lr or r.lr for r14, rbase or r.base
for r3 and rpgt or r.pgt for r4.

   `*' is the current location counter.  Unlike `.' it is always
relative to the last USING directive.  Note that this means that
expressions cannot use multiplication, as any occurrence of `*' will be
interpreted as a location counter.

   All labels are relative to the last USING.  Thus, branches to a label
always imply the use of base+displacement.

   Many of the usual forms of address constants / address literals are
supported.  Thus,
     	.using	*,r3
     	L	r15,=A(some_routine)
     	LM	r6,r7,=V(some_longlong_extern)
     	A	r1,=F'12'
     	AH	r0,=H'42'
     	ME	r6,=E'3.1416'
     	MD	r6,=D'3.14159265358979'
     	O	r6,=XL4'cacad0d0'
     	.ltorg
   should all behave as expected: that is, an entry in the literal pool
will be created (or reused if it already exists), and the instruction
operands will be the displacement into the literal pool using the
current base register (as last declared with the `.using' directive).

9.14.5 ESA/390 Assembler Directives
-----------------------------------

`as' for the ESA/390 supports all of the standard ELF/SVR4 assembler
directives that are documented in the main part of this documentation.
Several additional directives are supported in order to implement the
ESA/390 addressing model.  The most important of these are `.using' and
`.ltorg'

   These are the additional directives in `as' for the ESA/390:

`.dc'
     A small subset of the usual DC directive is supported.

`.drop REGNO'
     Stop using REGNO as the base register.  The REGNO must have been
     previously declared with a `.using' directive in the same section
     as the current section.

`.ebcdic STRING'
     Emit the EBCDIC equivalent of the indicated string.  The emitted
     string will be null terminated.  Note that the directives
     `.string' etc. emit ascii strings by default.

`EQU'
     The standard HLASM-style EQU directive is not supported; however,
     the standard `as' directive .equ can be used to the same effect.

`.ltorg'
     Dump the literal pool accumulated so far; begin a new literal pool.
     The literal pool will be written in the current section; in order
     to generate correct assembly, a `.using' must have been previously
     specified in the same section.

`.using EXPR,REGNO'
     Use REGNO as the base register for all subsequent RX, RS, and SS
     form instructions. The EXPR will be evaluated to obtain the base
     address; usually, EXPR will merely be `*'.

     This assembler allows two `.using' directives to be simultaneously
     outstanding, one in the `.text' section, and one in another section
     (typically, the `.data' section).  This feature allows dynamically
     loaded objects to be implemented in a relatively straightforward
     way.  A `.using' directive must always be specified in the `.text'
     section; this will specify the base register that will be used for
     branches in the `.text' section.  A second `.using' may be
     specified in another section; this will specify the base register
     that is used for non-label address literals.  When a second
     `.using' is specified, then the subsequent `.ltorg' must be put in
     the same section; otherwise an error will result.

     Thus, for example, the following code uses `r3' to address branch
     targets and `r4' to address the literal pool, which has been
     written to the `.data' section.  The is, the constants
     `=A(some_routine)', `=H'42'' and `=E'3.1416'' will all appear in
     the `.data' section.

          .data
          	.using  LITPOOL,r4
          .text
          	BASR	r3,0
          	.using	*,r3
                  B       START
          	.long	LITPOOL
          START:
          	L	r4,4(,r3)
          	L	r15,=A(some_routine)
          	LTR	r15,r15
          	BNE	LABEL
          	AH	r0,=H'42'
          LABEL:
          	ME	r6,=E'3.1416'
          .data
          LITPOOL:
          	.ltorg

     Note that this dual-`.using' directive semantics extends and is
     not compatible with HLASM semantics.  Note that this assembler
     directive does not support the full range of HLASM semantics.

     Select the word size, either 32 bits or 64 bits.  `--32' implies
     Intel i386 architecture, while `--x32' and `--64' imply AMD x86-64
     architecture with 32-bit or 64-bit word-size respectively.

     These options are only available with the ELF object file format,
     and require that the necessary BFD support has been included (on a
     32-bit platform you have to add -enable-64-bit-bfd to configure
     enable 64-bit usage and use x86-64 as target platform).

`-n'
     By default, x86 GAS replaces multiple nop instructions used for
     alignment within code sections with multi-byte nop instructions
     such as leal 0(%esi,1),%esi.  This switch disables the
     optimization.

`--divide'
     On SVR4-derived platforms, the character `/' is treated as a
     comment character, which means that it cannot be used in
     expressions.  The `--divide' option turns `/' into a normal
     character.  This does not disable `/' at the beginning of a line
     starting a comment, or affect using `#' for starting a comment.

`-march=CPU[+EXTENSION...]'
     This option specifies the target processor.  The assembler will
     issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an
     instruction which will not execute on the target processor.  The
     following processor names are recognized: `i8086', `i186', `i286',
     `i386', `i486', `i586', `i686', `pentium', `pentiumpro',
     `pentiumii', `pentiumiii', `pentium4', `prescott', `nocona',
     `core', `core2', `corei7', `l1om', `k1om', `iamcu', `k6', `k6_2',
     `athlon', `opteron', `k8', `amdfam10', `bdver1', `bdver2',
     `bdver3', `bdver4', `znver1', `btver1', `btver2', `generic32' and
     `generic64'.

     In addition to the basic instruction set, the assembler can be
     told to accept various extension mnemonics.  For example,
     `-march=i686+sse4+vmx' extends I686 with SSE4 and VMX.  The
     following extensions are currently supported: `8087', `287', `387',
     `687', `no87', `no287', `no387', `no687', `mmx', `nommx', `sse',
     `sse2', `sse3', `ssse3', `sse4.1', `sse4.2', `sse4', `nosse',
     `nosse2', `nosse3', `nossse3', `nosse4.1', `nosse4.2', `nosse4',
     `avx', `avx2', `noavx', `noavx2', `adx', `rdseed', `prfchw',
     `smap', `mpx', `sha', `rdpid', `ptwrite', `cet', `prefetchwt1',
     `clflushopt', `se1', `clwb', `avx512f', `avx512cd', `avx512er',
     `avx512pf', `avx512vl', `avx512bw', `avx512dq', `avx512ifma',
     `avx512vbmi', `avx512_4fmaps', `avx512_4vnniw', `avx512_vpopcntdq',
     `noavx512f', `noavx512cd', `noavx512er', `noavx512pf',
     `noavx512vl', `noavx512bw', `noavx512dq', `noavx512ifma',
     `noavx512vbmi', `noavx512_4fmaps', `noavx512_4vnniw',
     `noavx512_vpopcntdq', `vmx', `vmfunc', `smx', `xsave', `xsaveopt',
     `xsavec', `xsaves', `aes', `pclmul', `fsgsbase', `rdrnd', `f16c',
     `bmi2', `fma', `movbe', `ept', `lzcnt', `hle', `rtm', `invpcid',
     `clflush', `mwaitx', `clzero', `lwp', `fma4', `xop', `cx16',
     `syscall', `rdtscp', `3dnow', `3dnowa', `sse4a', `sse5', `svme',
     `abm' and `padlock'.  Note that rather than extending a basic
     instruction set, the extension mnemonics starting with `no' revoke
     the respective functionality.

     When the `.arch' directive is used with `-march', the `.arch'
     directive will take precedent.

`-mtune=CPU'
     This option specifies a processor to optimize for. When used in
     conjunction with the `-march' option, only instructions of the
     processor specified by the `-march' option will be generated.

     Valid CPU values are identical to the processor list of
     `-march=CPU'.

`-msse2avx'
     This option specifies that the assembler should encode SSE
     instructions with VEX prefix.

`-msse-check=NONE'
`-msse-check=WARNING'
`-msse-check=ERROR'
     These options control if the assembler should check SSE
     instructions.  `-msse-check=NONE' will make the assembler not to
     check SSE instructions,  which is the default.
     `-msse-check=WARNING' will make the assembler issue a warning for
     any SSE instruction.  `-msse-check=ERROR' will make the assembler
     issue an error for any SSE instruction.

`-mavxscalar=128'
`-mavxscalar=256'
     These options control how the assembler should encode scalar AVX
     instructions.  `-mavxscalar=128' will encode scalar AVX
     instructions with 128bit vector length, which is the default.
     `-mavxscalar=256' will encode scalar AVX instructions with 256bit
     vector length.

`-mevexlig=128'
`-mevexlig=256'
`-mevexlig=512'
     These options control how the assembler should encode
     length-ignored (LIG) EVEX instructions.  `-mevexlig=128' will
     encode LIG EVEX instructions with 128bit vector length, which is
     the default.  `-mevexlig=256' and `-mevexlig=512' will encode LIG
     EVEX instructions with 256bit and 512bit vector length,
     respectively.

`-mevexwig=0'
`-mevexwig=1'
     These options control how the assembler should encode w-ignored
     (WIG) EVEX instructions.  `-mevexwig=0' will encode WIG EVEX
     instructions with evex.w = 0, which is the default.  `-mevexwig=1'
     will encode WIG EVEX instructions with evex.w = 1.

`-mmnemonic=ATT'
`-mmnemonic=INTEL'
     This option specifies instruction mnemonic for matching
     instructions.  The `.att_mnemonic' and `.intel_mnemonic'
     directives will take precedent.

`-msyntax=ATT'
`-msyntax=INTEL'
     This option specifies instruction syntax when processing
     instructions.  The `.att_syntax' and `.intel_syntax' directives
     will take precedent.

`-mnaked-reg'
     This option specifies that registers don't require a `%' prefix.
     The `.att_syntax' and `.intel_syntax' directives will take
     precedent.

`-madd-bnd-prefix'
     This option forces the assembler to add BND prefix to all
     branches, even if such prefix was not explicitly specified in the
     source code.

`-mno-shared'
     On ELF target, the assembler normally optimizes out non-PLT
     relocations against defined non-weak global branch targets with
     default visibility.  The `-mshared' option tells the assembler to
     generate code which may go into a shared library where all
     non-weak global branch targets with default visibility can be
     preempted.  The resulting code is slightly bigger.  This option
     only affects the handling of branch instructions.

`-mbig-obj'
     On x86-64 PE/COFF target this option forces the use of big object
     file format, which allows more than 32768 sections.

`-momit-lock-prefix=NO'
`-momit-lock-prefix=YES'
     These options control how the assembler should encode lock prefix.
     This option is intended as a workaround for processors, that fail
     on lock prefix. This option can only be safely used with
     single-core, single-thread computers `-momit-lock-prefix=YES' will
     omit all lock prefixes.  `-momit-lock-prefix=NO' will encode lock
     prefix as usual, which is the default.

`-mfence-as-lock-add=NO'
`-mfence-as-lock-add=YES'
     These options control how the assembler should encode lfence,
     mfence and sfence.  `-mfence-as-lock-add=YES' will encode lfence,
     mfence and sfence as `lock addl $0x0, (%rsp)' in 64-bit mode and
     `lock addl $0x0, (%esp)' in 32-bit mode.  `-mfence-as-lock-add=NO'
     will encode lfence, mfence and sfence as usual, which is the
     default.

`-mrelax-relocations=NO'
`-mrelax-relocations=YES'
     These options control whether the assembler should generate relax
     relocations, R_386_GOT32X, in 32-bit mode, or R_X86_64_GOTPCRELX
     and R_X86_64_REX_GOTPCRELX, in 64-bit mode.
     `-mrelax-relocations=YES' will generate relax relocations.
     `-mrelax-relocations=NO' will not generate relax relocations.  The
     default can be controlled by a configure option
     `--enable-x86-relax-relocations'.

`-mevexrcig=RNE'
`-mevexrcig=RD'
`-mevexrcig=RU'
`-mevexrcig=RZ'
     These options control how the assembler should encode SAE-only
     EVEX instructions.  `-mevexrcig=RNE' will encode RC bits of EVEX
     instruction with 00, which is the default.  `-mevexrcig=RD',
     `-mevexrcig=RU' and `-mevexrcig=RZ' will encode SAE-only EVEX
     instructions with 01, 10 and 11 RC bits, respectively.

`-mamd64'
`-mintel64'
     This option specifies that the assembler should accept only AMD64
     or Intel64 ISA in 64-bit mode.  The default is to accept both.

9.15.2 x86 specific Directives
------------------------------

`.lcomm SYMBOL , LENGTH[, ALIGNMENT]'
     Reserve LENGTH (an absolute expression) bytes for a local common
     denoted by SYMBOL.  The section and value of SYMBOL are those of
     the new local common.  The addresses are allocated in the bss
     section, so that at run-time the bytes start off zeroed.  Since
     SYMBOL is not declared global, it is normally not visible to `ld'.
     The optional third parameter, ALIGNMENT, specifies the desired
     alignment of the symbol in the bss section.

     This directive is only available for COFF based x86 targets.

9.15.3.1 AT&T Syntax versus Intel Syntax
........................................

`as' now supports assembly using Intel assembler syntax.
`.intel_syntax' selects Intel mode, and `.att_syntax' switches back to
the usual AT&T mode for compatibility with the output of `gcc'.  Either
of these directives may have an optional argument, `prefix', or
`noprefix' specifying whether registers require a `%' prefix.  AT&T
System V/386 assembler syntax is quite different from Intel syntax.  We
mention these differences because almost all 80386 documents use Intel
syntax.  Notable differences between the two syntaxes are:

   * AT&T immediate operands are preceded by `$'; Intel immediate
     operands are undelimited (Intel `push 4' is AT&T `pushl $4').
     AT&T register operands are preceded by `%'; Intel register operands
     are undelimited.  AT&T absolute (as opposed to PC relative)
     jump/call operands are prefixed by `*'; they are undelimited in
     Intel syntax.

   * AT&T and Intel syntax use the opposite order for source and
     destination operands.  Intel `add eax, 4' is `addl $4, %eax'.  The
     `source, dest' convention is maintained for compatibility with
     previous Unix assemblers.  Note that `bound', `invlpga', and
     instructions with 2 immediate operands, such as the `enter'
     instruction, do _not_ have reversed order.  *Note i386-Bugs::.

   * In AT&T syntax the size of memory operands is determined from the
     last character of the instruction mnemonic.  Mnemonic suffixes of
     `b', `w', `l' and `q' specify byte (8-bit), word (16-bit), long
     (32-bit) and quadruple word (64-bit) memory references.  Intel
     syntax accomplishes this by prefixing memory operands (_not_ the
     instruction mnemonics) with `byte ptr', `word ptr', `dword ptr'
     and `qword ptr'.  Thus, Intel `mov al, byte ptr FOO' is `movb FOO,
     %al' in AT&T syntax.

     In 64-bit code, `movabs' can be used to encode the `mov'
     instruction with the 64-bit displacement or immediate operand.

   * Immediate form long jumps and calls are `lcall/ljmp $SECTION,
     $OFFSET' in AT&T syntax; the Intel syntax is `call/jmp far
     SECTION:OFFSET'.  Also, the far return instruction is `lret
     $STACK-ADJUST' in AT&T syntax; Intel syntax is `ret far
     STACK-ADJUST'.

   * The AT&T assembler does not provide support for multiple section
     programs.  Unix style systems expect all programs to be single
     sections.

9.15.3.2 Special Characters
...........................

The presence of a `#' appearing anywhere on a line indicates the start
of a comment that extends to the end of that line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   If the `--divide' command line option has not been specified then
the `/' character appearing anywhere on a line also introduces a line
comment.

   The `;' character can be used to separate statements on the same
line.

9.15.4 i386-Mnemonics
---------------------

9.15.4.1 Instruction Naming
...........................

Instruction mnemonics are suffixed with one character modifiers which
specify the size of operands.  The letters `b', `w', `l' and `q'
specify byte, word, long and quadruple word operands.  If no suffix is
specified by an instruction then `as' tries to fill in the missing
suffix based on the destination register operand (the last one by
convention).  Thus, `mov %ax, %bx' is equivalent to `movw %ax, %bx';
also, `mov $1, %bx' is equivalent to `movw $1, bx'.  Note that this is
incompatible with the AT&T Unix assembler which assumes that a missing
mnemonic suffix implies long operand size.  (This incompatibility does
not affect compiler output since compilers always explicitly specify
the mnemonic suffix.)

   Almost all instructions have the same names in AT&T and Intel format.
There are a few exceptions.  The sign extend and zero extend
instructions need two sizes to specify them.  They need a size to
sign/zero extend _from_ and a size to zero extend _to_.  This is
accomplished by using two instruction mnemonic suffixes in AT&T syntax.
Base names for sign extend and zero extend are `movs...' and `movz...'
in AT&T syntax (`movsx' and `movzx' in Intel syntax).  The instruction
mnemonic suffixes are tacked on to this base name, the _from_ suffix
before the _to_ suffix.  Thus, `movsbl %al, %edx' is AT&T syntax for
"move sign extend _from_ %al _to_ %edx."  Possible suffixes, thus, are
`bl' (from byte to long), `bw' (from byte to word), `wl' (from word to
long), `bq' (from byte to quadruple word), `wq' (from word to quadruple
word), and `lq' (from long to quadruple word).

   Different encoding options can be specified via pseudo prefixes:

   * `{disp8}' - prefer 8-bit displacement.

   * `{disp32}' - prefer 32-bit displacement.

   * `{load}' - prefer load-form instruction.

   * `{store}' - prefer store-form instruction.

   * `{vex2}' - prefer 2-byte VEX prefix for VEX instruction.

   * `{vex3}' - prefer 3-byte VEX prefix for VEX instruction.

   * `{evex}' -  encode with EVEX prefix.

   The Intel-syntax conversion instructions

   * `cbw' -- sign-extend byte in `%al' to word in `%ax',

   * `cwde' -- sign-extend word in `%ax' to long in `%eax',

   * `cwd' -- sign-extend word in `%ax' to long in `%dx:%ax',

   * `cdq' -- sign-extend dword in `%eax' to quad in `%edx:%eax',

   * `cdqe' -- sign-extend dword in `%eax' to quad in `%rax' (x86-64
     only),

   * `cqo' -- sign-extend quad in `%rax' to octuple in `%rdx:%rax'
     (x86-64 only),

are called `cbtw', `cwtl', `cwtd', `cltd', `cltq', and `cqto' in AT&T
naming.  `as' accepts either naming for these instructions.

   Far call/jump instructions are `lcall' and `ljmp' in AT&T syntax,
but are `call far' and `jump far' in Intel convention.

9.15.4.2 AT&T Mnemonic versus Intel Mnemonic
............................................

`as' supports assembly using Intel mnemonic.  `.intel_mnemonic' selects
Intel mnemonic with Intel syntax, and `.att_mnemonic' switches back to
the usual AT&T mnemonic with AT&T syntax for compatibility with the
output of `gcc'.  Several x87 instructions, `fadd', `fdiv', `fdivp',
`fdivr', `fdivrp', `fmul', `fsub', `fsubp', `fsubr' and `fsubrp',  are
implemented in AT&T System V/386 assembler with different mnemonics
from those in Intel IA32 specification.  `gcc' generates those
instructions with AT&T mnemonic.

9.15.5 Register Naming
----------------------

Register operands are always prefixed with `%'.  The 80386 registers
consist of

   * the 8 32-bit registers `%eax' (the accumulator), `%ebx', `%ecx',
     `%edx', `%edi', `%esi', `%ebp' (the frame pointer), and `%esp'
     (the stack pointer).

   * the 8 16-bit low-ends of these: `%ax', `%bx', `%cx', `%dx', `%di',
     `%si', `%bp', and `%sp'.

   * the 8 8-bit registers: `%ah', `%al', `%bh', `%bl', `%ch', `%cl',
     `%dh', and `%dl' (These are the high-bytes and low-bytes of `%ax',
     `%bx', `%cx', and `%dx')

   * the 6 section registers `%cs' (code section), `%ds' (data
     section), `%ss' (stack section), `%es', `%fs', and `%gs'.

   * the 5 processor control registers `%cr0', `%cr2', `%cr3', `%cr4',
     and `%cr8'.

   * the 6 debug registers `%db0', `%db1', `%db2', `%db3', `%db6', and
     `%db7'.

   * the 2 test registers `%tr6' and `%tr7'.

   * the 8 floating point register stack `%st' or equivalently
     `%st(0)', `%st(1)', `%st(2)', `%st(3)', `%st(4)', `%st(5)',
     `%st(6)', and `%st(7)'.  These registers are overloaded by 8 MMX
     registers `%mm0', `%mm1', `%mm2', `%mm3', `%mm4', `%mm5', `%mm6'
     and `%mm7'.

   * the 8 128-bit SSE registers registers `%xmm0', `%xmm1', `%xmm2',
     `%xmm3', `%xmm4', `%xmm5', `%xmm6' and `%xmm7'.

   The AMD x86-64 architecture extends the register set by:

   * enhancing the 8 32-bit registers to 64-bit: `%rax' (the
     accumulator), `%rbx', `%rcx', `%rdx', `%rdi', `%rsi', `%rbp' (the
     frame pointer), `%rsp' (the stack pointer)

   * the 8 extended registers `%r8'-`%r15'.

   * the 8 32-bit low ends of the extended registers: `%r8d'-`%r15d'.

   * the 8 16-bit low ends of the extended registers: `%r8w'-`%r15w'.

   * the 8 8-bit low ends of the extended registers: `%r8b'-`%r15b'.

   * the 4 8-bit registers: `%sil', `%dil', `%bpl', `%spl'.

   * the 8 debug registers: `%db8'-`%db15'.

   * the 8 128-bit SSE registers: `%xmm8'-`%xmm15'.

   With the AVX extensions more registers were made available:

   * the 16 256-bit SSE `%ymm0'-`%ymm15' (only the first 8 available in
     32-bit mode).  The bottom 128 bits are overlaid with the
     `xmm0'-`xmm15' registers.


   The AVX2 extensions made in 64-bit mode more registers available:

   * the 16 128-bit registers `%xmm16'-`%xmm31' and the 16 256-bit
     registers `%ymm16'-`%ymm31'.


   The AVX512 extensions added the following registers:

   * the 32 512-bit registers `%zmm0'-`%zmm31' (only the first 8
     available in 32-bit mode).  The bottom 128 bits are overlaid with
     the `%xmm0'-`%xmm31' registers and the first 256 bits are overlaid
     with the `%ymm0'-`%ymm31' registers.

   * the 8 mask registers `%k0'-`%k7'.

9.15.6 Instruction Prefixes
---------------------------

Instruction prefixes are used to modify the following instruction.  They
are used to repeat string instructions, to provide section overrides, to
perform bus lock operations, and to change operand and address sizes.
(Most instructions that normally operate on 32-bit operands will use
16-bit operands if the instruction has an "operand size" prefix.)
Instruction prefixes are best written on the same line as the
instruction they act upon. For example, the `scas' (scan string)
instruction is repeated with:

             repne scas %es:(%edi),%al

   You may also place prefixes on the lines immediately preceding the
instruction, but this circumvents checks that `as' does with prefixes,
and will not work with all prefixes.

   Here is a list of instruction prefixes:

   * Section override prefixes `cs', `ds', `ss', `es', `fs', `gs'.
     These are automatically added by specifying using the
     SECTION:MEMORY-OPERAND form for memory references.

   * Operand/Address size prefixes `data16' and `addr16' change 32-bit
     operands/addresses into 16-bit operands/addresses, while `data32'
     and `addr32' change 16-bit ones (in a `.code16' section) into
     32-bit operands/addresses.  These prefixes _must_ appear on the
     same line of code as the instruction they modify. For example, in
     a 16-bit `.code16' section, you might write:

                  addr32 jmpl *(%ebx)

   * The bus lock prefix `lock' inhibits interrupts during execution of
     the instruction it precedes.  (This is only valid with certain
     instructions; see a 80386 manual for details).

   * The wait for coprocessor prefix `wait' waits for the coprocessor to
     complete the current instruction.  This should never be needed for
     the 80386/80387 combination.

   * The `rep', `repe', and `repne' prefixes are added to string
     instructions to make them repeat `%ecx' times (`%cx' times if the
     current address size is 16-bits).  

   * The `rex' family of prefixes is used by x86-64 to encode
     extensions to i386 instruction set.  The `rex' prefix has four
     bits -- an operand size overwrite (`64') used to change operand
     size from 32-bit to 64-bit and X, Y and Z extensions bits used to
     extend the register set.

     You may write the `rex' prefixes directly. The `rex64xyz'
     instruction emits `rex' prefix with all the bits set.  By omitting
     the `64', `x', `y' or `z' you may write other prefixes as well.
     Normally, there is no need to write the prefixes explicitly, since

9.15.7 Memory References
------------------------

An Intel syntax indirect memory reference of the form

     SECTION:[BASE + INDEX*SCALE + DISP]

is translated into the AT&T syntax

     SECTION:DISP(BASE, INDEX, SCALE)

where BASE and INDEX are the optional 32-bit base and index registers,
DISP is the optional displacement, and SCALE, taking the values 1, 2,
4, and 8, multiplies INDEX to calculate the address of the operand.  If
no SCALE is specified, SCALE is taken to be 1.  SECTION specifies the
optional section register for the memory operand, and may override the
default section register (see a 80386 manual for section register
defaults). Note that section overrides in AT&T syntax _must_ be
preceded by a `%'.  If you specify a section override which coincides
with the default section register, `as' does _not_ output any section
register override prefixes to assemble the given instruction.  Thus,
section overrides can be specified to emphasize which section register
is used for a given memory operand.

   Here are some examples of Intel and AT&T style memory references:

AT&T: `-4(%ebp)', Intel:  `[ebp - 4]'
     BASE is `%ebp'; DISP is `-4'. SECTION is missing, and the default
     section is used (`%ss' for addressing with `%ebp' as the base
     register).  INDEX, SCALE are both missing.

AT&T: `foo(,%eax,4)', Intel: `[foo + eax*4]'
     INDEX is `%eax' (scaled by a SCALE 4); DISP is `foo'.  All other
     fields are missing.  The section register here defaults to `%ds'.

AT&T: `foo(,1)'; Intel `[foo]'
     This uses the value pointed to by `foo' as a memory operand.  Note
     that BASE and INDEX are both missing, but there is only _one_ `,'.
     This is a syntactic exception.

AT&T: `%gs:foo'; Intel `gs:foo'
     This selects the contents of the variable `foo' with section
     register SECTION being `%gs'.

   Absolute (as opposed to PC relative) call and jump operands must be
prefixed with `*'.  If no `*' is specified, `as' always chooses PC
relative addressing for jump/call labels.

   Any instruction that has a memory operand, but no register operand,
_must_ specify its size (byte, word, long, or quadruple) with an
instruction mnemonic suffix (`b', `w', `l' or `q', respectively).

   The x86-64 architecture adds an RIP (instruction pointer relative)
addressing.  This addressing mode is specified by using `rip' as a base
register.  Only constant offsets are valid. For example:

AT&T: `1234(%rip)', Intel: `[rip + 1234]'
     Points to the address 1234 bytes past the end of the current
     instruction.

AT&T: `symbol(%rip)', Intel: `[rip + symbol]'
     Points to the `symbol' in RIP relative way, this is shorter than
     the default absolute addressing.

   Other addressing modes remain unchanged in x86-64 architecture,
except registers used are 64-bit instead of 32-bit.

9.15.8 Handling of Jump Instructions
------------------------------------

Jump instructions are always optimized to use the smallest possible
displacements.  This is accomplished by using byte (8-bit) displacement
jumps whenever the target is sufficiently close.  If a byte displacement
is insufficient a long displacement is used.  We do not support word
(16-bit) displacement jumps in 32-bit mode (i.e. prefixing the jump
instruction with the `data16' instruction prefix), since the 80386
insists upon masking `%eip' to 16 bits after the word displacement is
added. (See also *note i386-Arch::)

   Note that the `jcxz', `jecxz', `loop', `loopz', `loope', `loopnz'
and `loopne' instructions only come in byte displacements, so that if
you use these instructions (`gcc' does not use them) you may get an
error message (and incorrect code).  The AT&T 80386 assembler tries to
get around this problem by expanding `jcxz foo' to

              jcxz cx_zero
              jmp cx_nonzero
     cx_zero: jmp foo
     cx_nonzero:

9.15.9 Floating Point
---------------------

All 80387 floating point types except packed BCD are supported.  (BCD
support may be added without much difficulty).  These data types are
16-, 32-, and 64- bit integers, and single (32-bit), double (64-bit),
and extended (80-bit) precision floating point.  Each supported type
has an instruction mnemonic suffix and a constructor associated with
it.  Instruction mnemonic suffixes specify the operand's data type.
Constructors build these data types into memory.

   * Floating point constructors are `.float' or `.single', `.double',
     and `.tfloat' for 32-, 64-, and 80-bit formats.  These correspond
     to instruction mnemonic suffixes `s', `l', and `t'. `t' stands for
     80-bit (ten byte) real.  The 80387 only supports this format via
     the `fldt' (load 80-bit real to stack top) and `fstpt' (store
     80-bit real and pop stack) instructions.

   * Integer constructors are `.word', `.long' or `.int', and `.quad'
     for the 16-, 32-, and 64-bit integer formats.  The corresponding
     instruction mnemonic suffixes are `s' (single), `l' (long), and
     `q' (quad).  As with the 80-bit real format, the 64-bit `q' format
     is only present in the `fildq' (load quad integer to stack top)
     and `fistpq' (store quad integer and pop stack) instructions.

   Register to register operations should not use instruction mnemonic
suffixes.  `fstl %st, %st(1)' will give a warning, and be assembled as
if you wrote `fst %st, %st(1)', since all register to register
operations use 80-bit floating point operands. (Contrast this with
`fstl %st, mem', which converts `%st' from 80-bit to 64-bit floating
point format, then stores the result in the 4 byte location `mem')

9.15.10 Intel's MMX and AMD's 3DNow! SIMD Operations
----------------------------------------------------

`as' supports Intel's MMX instruction set (SIMD instructions for
integer data), available on Intel's Pentium MMX processors and Pentium
II processors, AMD's K6 and K6-2 processors, Cyrix' M2 processor, and
probably others.  It also supports AMD's 3DNow!  instruction set (SIMD
instructions for 32-bit floating point data) available on AMD's K6-2
processor and possibly others in the future.

   Currently, `as' does not support Intel's floating point SIMD, Katmai
(KNI).

   The eight 64-bit MMX operands, also used by 3DNow!, are called
`%mm0', `%mm1', ... `%mm7'.  They contain eight 8-bit integers, four
16-bit integers, two 32-bit integers, one 64-bit integer, or two 32-bit
floating point values.  The MMX registers cannot be used at the same
time as the floating point stack.

   See Intel and AMD documentation, keeping in mind that the operand
order in instructions is reversed from the Intel syntax.

9.15.11 AMD's Lightweight Profiling Instructions
------------------------------------------------

`as' supports AMD's Lightweight Profiling (LWP) instruction set,
available on AMD's Family 15h (Orochi) processors.

   LWP enables applications to collect and manage performance data, and
react to performance events.  The collection of performance data
requires no context switches.  LWP runs in the context of a thread and
so several counters can be used independently across multiple threads.
LWP can be used in both 64-bit and legacy 32-bit modes.

   For detailed information on the LWP instruction set, see the `AMD
Lightweight Profiling Specification' available at Lightweight Profiling
Specification (http://developer.amd.com/cpu/LWP).

9.15.12 Bit Manipulation Instructions

`as' supports the Bit Manipulation (BMI) instruction set.

   BMI instructions provide several instructions implementing individual
bit manipulation operations such as isolation, masking, setting, or
resetting.

9.15.13 AMD's Trailing Bit Manipulation Instructions
----------------------------------------------------

`as' supports AMD's Trailing Bit Manipulation (TBM) instruction set,
available on AMD's BDVER2 processors (Trinity and Viperfish).

   TBM instructions provide instructions implementing individual bit
manipulation operations such as isolating, masking, setting, resetting,
complementing, and operations on trailing zeros and ones.

9.15.14 Writing 16-bit Code
---------------------------

While `as' normally writes only "pure" 32-bit i386 code or 64-bit
x86-64 code depending on the default configuration, it also supports
writing code to run in real mode or in 16-bit protected mode code
segments.  To do this, put a `.code16' or `.code16gcc' directive before
the assembly language instructions to be run in 16-bit mode.  You can
switch `as' to writing 32-bit code with the `.code32' directive or
64-bit code with the `.code64' directive.

   `.code16gcc' provides experimental support for generating 16-bit
code from gcc, and differs from `.code16' in that `call', `ret',
`enter', `leave', `push', `pop', `pusha', `popa', `pushf', and `popf'
instructions default to 32-bit size.  This is so that the stack pointer
is manipulated in the same way over function calls, allowing access to
function parameters at the same stack offsets as in 32-bit mode.
`.code16gcc' also automatically adds address size prefixes where
necessary to use the 32-bit addressing modes that gcc generates.

   The code which `as' generates in 16-bit mode will not necessarily
run on a 16-bit pre-80386 processor.  To write code that runs on such a
processor, you must refrain from using _any_ 32-bit constructs which
require `as' to output address or operand size prefixes.

   Note that writing 16-bit code instructions by explicitly specifying a
prefix or an instruction mnemonic suffix within a 32-bit code section
generates different machine instructions than those generated for a
16-bit code segment.  In a 32-bit code section, the following code
generates the machine opcode bytes `66 6a 04', which pushes the value
`4' onto the stack, decrementing `%esp' by 2.

             pushw $4

   The same code in a 16-bit code section would generate the machine
opcode bytes `6a 04' (i.e., without the operand size prefix), which is
correct since the processor default operand size is assumed to be 16
bits in a 16-bit code section.

9.15.15 Specifying CPU Architecture

`as' may be told to assemble for a particular CPU (sub-)architecture
with the `.arch CPU_TYPE' directive.  This directive enables a warning
when gas detects an instruction that is not supported on the CPU
specified.  The choices for CPU_TYPE are:

`i8086'        `i186'         `i286'         `i386'
`i486'         `i586'         `i686'         `pentium'
`pentiumpro'   `pentiumii'    `pentiumiii'   `pentium4'
`prescott'     `nocona'       `core'         `core2'
`corei7'       `l1om'         `k1om' `iamcu' 
`k6'           `k6_2'         `athlon'       `k8'

`bdver4'       `znver1'       `btver1'       `btver2'
`generic32'    `generic64'                   
`.mmx'         `.sse'         `.sse2'        `.sse3'
`.ssse3'       `.sse4.1'      `.sse4.2'      `.sse4'
`.avx'         `.vmx'         `.smx'         `.ept'

`.lzcnt'       `.invpcid'     `.vmfunc'      `.hle'
`.rtm'         `.adx'         `.rdseed'      `.prfchw'
`.smap'        `.mpx'         `.sha'         `.prefetchwt1'
`.clflushopt'  `.xsavec'      `.xsaves'      `.se1'
`.avx512f'     `.avx512cd'    `.avx512er'    `.avx512pf'
`.avx512vl'    `.avx512bw'    `.avx512dq'    `.avx512ifma'
`.avx512vbmi'  `.avx512_4fmaps'`.avx512_4vnniw'
`.avx512_vpopcntdq'`.clwb'        `.rdpid'       `.ptwrite'
`.cet'                                       
`.3dnow'       `.3dnowa'      `.sse4a'       `.sse5'
`.syscall'     `.rdtscp'      `.svme'        `.abm'
`.lwp'         `.fma4'        `.xop'         `.cx16'
`.padlock'     `.clzero'      `.mwaitx'      

   Apart from the warning, there are only two other effects on `as'
operation;  Firstly, if you specify a CPU other than `i486', then shift
by one instructions such as `sarl $1, %eax' will automatically use a
two byte opcode sequence.  The larger three byte opcode sequence is
used on the 486 (and when no architecture is specified) because it
executes faster on the 486.  Note that you can explicitly request the
two byte opcode by writing `sarl %eax'.  Secondly, if you specify
`i8086', `i186', or `i286', _and_ `.code16' or `.code16gcc' then byte
offset conditional jumps will be promoted when necessary to a two
instruction sequence consisting of a conditional jump of the opposite
sense around an unconditional jump to the target.

   Following the CPU architecture (but not a sub-architecture, which
are those starting with a dot), you may specify `jumps' or `nojumps' to
control automatic promotion of conditional jumps. `jumps' is the
default, and enables jump promotion;  All external jumps will be of the
long variety, and file-local jumps will be promoted as necessary.
(*note i386-Jumps::)  `nojumps' leaves external conditional jumps as
byte offset jumps, and warns about file-local conditional jumps that
`as' promotes.  Unconditional jumps are treated as for `jumps'.

   For example

      .arch i8086,nojumps

9.15.16 AT&T Syntax bugs
------------------------

The UnixWare assembler, and probably other AT&T derived ix86 Unix
assemblers, generate floating point instructions with reversed source
and destination registers in certain cases.  Unfortunately, gcc and
possibly many other programs use this reversed syntax, so we're stuck
with it.

   For example

             fsub %st,%st(3)
   results in `%st(3)' being updated to `%st - %st(3)' rather than the
expected `%st(3) - %st'.  This happens with all the non-commutative
arithmetic floating point operations with two register operands where
the source register is `%st' and the destination register is `%st(i)'.


File: as.info,  Node: i386-Notes,  Prev: i386-Bugs,  Up: i386-Dependent

9.15.17 Notes
-------------

There is some trickery concerning the `mul' and `imul' instructions
that deserves mention.  The 16-, 32-, 64- and 128-bit expanding
multiplies (base opcode `0xf6'; extension 4 for `mul' and 5 for `imul')
can be output only in the one operand form.  Thus, `imul %ebx, %eax'
does _not_ select the expanding multiply; the expanding multiply would
clobber the `%edx' register, and this would confuse `gcc' output.  Use
`imul %ebx' to get the 64-bit product in `%edx:%eax'.

   We have added a two operand form of `imul' when the first operand is
an immediate mode expression and the second operand is a register.
This is just a shorthand, so that, multiplying `%eax' by 69, for
example, can be done with `imul $69, %eax' rather than `imul $69, %eax,
%eax'.

9.16.1 i860 Notes
-----------------

This is a fairly complete i860 assembler which is compatible with the
UNIX System V/860 Release 4 assembler. However, it does not currently
support SVR4 PIC (i.e., `@GOT, @GOTOFF, @PLT').

   Like the SVR4/860 assembler, the output object format is ELF32.
Currently, this is the only supported object format. If there is
sufficient interest, other formats such as COFF may be implemented.

   Both the Intel and AT&T/SVR4 syntaxes are supported, with the latter
being the default.  One difference is that AT&T syntax requires the '%'
prefix on register names while Intel syntax does not.  Another
difference is in the specification of relocatable expressions.  The
Intel syntax is `ha%expression' whereas the SVR4 syntax is
`[expression]@ha' (and similarly for the "l" and "h" selectors).

9.16.2.1 SVR4 compatibility options
...................................

`-V'
     Print assembler version.

`-Qy'
     Ignored.

`-Qn'

9.16.2.2 Other options
......................

`-EL'
     Select little endian output (this is the default).

`-EB'
     Select big endian output. Note that the i860 always reads
     instructions as little endian data, so this option only effects
     data and not instructions.

`-mwarn-expand'
     Emit a warning message if any pseudo-instruction expansions
     occurred.  For example, a `or' instruction with an immediate
     larger than 16-bits will be expanded into two instructions. This
     is a very undesirable feature to rely on, so this flag can help
     detect any code where it happens. One use of it, for instance, has
     been to find and eliminate any place where `gcc' may emit these
     pseudo-instructions.

`-mxp'
     Enable support for the i860XP instructions and control registers.
     By default, this option is disabled so that only the base
     instruction set (i.e., i860XR) is supported.

`-mintel-syntax'
     The i860 assembler defaults to AT&T/SVR4 syntax.  This option

9.16.3 i860 Machine Directives
------------------------------

`.dual'
     Enter dual instruction mode. While this directive is supported, the
     preferred way to use dual instruction mode is to explicitly code
     the dual bit with the `d.' prefix.

`.enddual'
     Exit dual instruction mode. While this directive is supported, the
     preferred way to use dual instruction mode is to explicitly code
     the dual bit with the `d.' prefix.

`.atmp'
     Change the temporary register used when expanding pseudo
     operations. The default register is `r31'.

   The `.dual', `.enddual', and `.atmp' directives are available only
in the Intel syntax mode.

   Both syntaxes allow for the standard `.align' directive.  However,
the Intel syntax additionally allows keywords for the alignment
parameter: "`.align type'", where `type' is one of `.short', `.long',
`.quad', `.single', `.double' representing alignments of 2, 4, 16, 4,
and 8, respectively.

All of the Intel i860XR and i860XP machine instructions are supported.

or _i860 Microprocessor Architecture_ for more information.

9.16.4.1 Other instruction support (pseudo-instructions)
........................................................

For compatibility with some other i860 assemblers, a number of
pseudo-instructions are supported. While these are supported, they are
a very undesirable feature that should be avoided - in particular, when
they result in an expansion to multiple actual i860 instructions. Below
are the pseudo-instructions that result in expansions.
   * Load large immediate into general register:

     The pseudo-instruction `mov imm,%rn' (where the immediate does not
     fit within a signed 16-bit field) will be expanded into:
          orh large_imm@h,%r0,%rn
          or large_imm@l,%rn,%rn

   * Load/store with relocatable address expression:

     For example, the pseudo-instruction `ld.b addr_exp(%rx),%rn' will
     be expanded into:
          orh addr_exp@ha,%rx,%r31
          ld.l addr_exp@l(%r31),%rn

     The analogous expansions apply to `ld.x, st.x, fld.x, pfld.x,
     fst.x', and `pst.x' as well.

   * Signed large immediate with add/subtract:

     If any of the arithmetic operations `adds, addu, subs, subu' are
     used with an immediate larger than 16-bits (signed), then they
     will be expanded.  For instance, the pseudo-instruction `adds
     large_imm,%rx,%rn' expands to:
          orh large_imm@h,%r0,%r31
          or large_imm@l,%r31,%r31
          adds %r31,%rx,%rn

   * Unsigned large immediate with logical operations:

     Logical operations (`or, andnot, or, xor') also result in
     expansions.  The pseudo-instruction `or large_imm,%rx,%rn' results
     in:
          orh large_imm@h,%rx,%r31
          or large_imm@l,%r31,%rn

     Similarly for the others, except for `and' which expands to:
          andnot (-1 - large_imm)@h,%rx,%r31
          andnot (-1 - large_imm)@l,%r31,%rn

9.17.1 i960 Command-line Options
--------------------------------

`-ACA | -ACA_A | -ACB | -ACC | -AKA | -AKB | -AKC | -AMC'
     Select the 80960 architecture.  Instructions or features not
     supported by the selected architecture cause fatal errors.

     `-ACA' is equivalent to `-ACA_A'; `-AKC' is equivalent to `-AMC'.
     Synonyms are provided for compatibility with other tools.

     If you do not specify any of these options, `as' generates code
     for any instruction or feature that is supported by _some_ version
     of the 960 (even if this means mixing architectures!).  In
     principle, `as' attempts to deduce the minimal sufficient
     processor type if none is specified; depending on the object code
     format, the processor type may be recorded in the object file.  If
     it is critical that the `as' output match a specific architecture,
     specify that architecture explicitly.

`-b'
     Add code to collect information about conditional branches taken,
     for later optimization using branch prediction bits.  (The
     conditional branch instructions have branch prediction bits in the
     CA, CB, and CC architectures.)  If BR represents a conditional
     branch instruction, the following represents the code generated by
     the assembler when `-b' is specified:

                  call    INCREMENT ROUTINE
                  .word   0       # pre-counter
          Label:  BR
                  call    INCREMENT ROUTINE
                  .word   0       # post-counter

     The counter following a branch records the number of times that
     branch was _not_ taken; the difference between the two counters is
     the number of times the branch _was_ taken.

     A table of every such `Label' is also generated, so that the
     external postprocessor `gbr960' (supplied by Intel) can locate all
     the counters.  This table is always labeled `__BRANCH_TABLE__';
     this is a local symbol to permit collecting statistics for many
     separate object files.  The table is word aligned, and begins with
     a two-word header.  The first word, initialized to 0, is used in
     maintaining linked lists of branch tables.  The second word is a
     count of the number of entries in the table, which follow
     immediately: each is a word, pointing to one of the labels
     illustrated above.

           +------------+------------+------------+ ... +------------+
           |            |            |            |     |            |
           |  *NEXT     |  COUNT: N  | *BRLAB 1   |     | *BRLAB N   |
           |            |            |            |     |            |
           +------------+------------+------------+ ... +------------+

                         __BRANCH_TABLE__ layout

     The first word of the header is used to locate multiple branch
     tables, since each object file may contain one. Normally the links
     are maintained with a call to an initialization routine, placed at
     the beginning of each function in the file.  The GNU C compiler
     generates these calls automatically when you give it a `-b' option.
     For further details, see the documentation of `gbr960'.

`-no-relax'
     Normally, Compare-and-Branch instructions with targets that require
     displacements greater than 13 bits (or that have external targets)
     are replaced with the corresponding compare (or `chkbit') and
     branch instructions.  You can use the `-no-relax' option to
     specify that `as' should generate errors instead, if the target
     displacement is larger than 13 bits.

     This option does not affect the Compare-and-Jump instructions; the
     code emitted for them is _always_ adjusted when necessary
     (depending on displacement size), regardless of whether you use
     `-no-relax'.

9.17.3 i960 Machine Directives
------------------------------

`.bss SYMBOL, LENGTH, ALIGN'
     Reserve LENGTH bytes in the bss section for a local SYMBOL,
     aligned to the power of two specified by ALIGN.  LENGTH and ALIGN
     must be positive absolute expressions.  This directive differs
     from `.lcomm' only in that it permits you to specify an alignment.
     *Note `.lcomm': Lcomm.

`.extended FLONUMS'
     `.extended' expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas; for
     each flonum, `.extended' emits an IEEE extended-format (80-bit)
     floating-point number.

`.leafproc CALL-LAB, BAL-LAB'
     You can use the `.leafproc' directive in conjunction with the
     optimized `callj' instruction to enable faster calls of leaf
     procedures.  If a procedure is known to call no other procedures,
     you may define an entry point that skips procedure prolog code
     (and that does not depend on system-supplied saved context), and
     declare it as the BAL-LAB using `.leafproc'.  If the procedure
     also has an entry point that goes through the normal prolog, you
     can specify that entry point as CALL-LAB.

     A `.leafproc' declaration is meant for use in conjunction with the
     optimized call instruction `callj'; the directive records the data
     needed later to choose between converting the `callj' into a `bal'
     or a `call'.

     CALL-LAB is optional; if only one argument is present, or if the
     two arguments are identical, the single argument is assumed to be
     the `bal' entry point.

`.sysproc NAME, INDEX'
     The `.sysproc' directive defines a name for a system procedure.
     After you define it using `.sysproc', you can use NAME to refer to
     the system procedure identified by INDEX when calling procedures
     with the optimized call instruction `callj'.

     Both arguments are required; INDEX must be between 0 and 31
     (inclusive).

9.17.4 i960 Opcodes
-------------------

All Intel 960 machine instructions are supported; *note i960
Command-line Options: Options-i960. for a discussion of selecting the
instruction subset for a particular 960 architecture.

   Some opcodes are processed beyond simply emitting a single
corresponding instruction: `callj', and Compare-and-Branch or
Compare-and-Jump instructions with target displacements larger than 13
bits.

9.17.4.1 `callj'
................

You can write `callj' to have the assembler or the linker determine the
most appropriate form of subroutine call: `call', `bal', or `calls'.
If the assembly source contains enough information--a `.leafproc' or
`.sysproc' directive defining the operand--then `as' translates the
`callj'; if not, it simply emits the `callj', leaving it for the linker
to resolve.


File: as.info,  Node: Compare-and-branch-i960,  Prev: callj-i960,  Up: Opcodes for i960

9.17.4.2 Compare-and-Branch
...........................

The 960 architectures provide combined Compare-and-Branch instructions
that permit you to store the branch target in the lower 13 bits of the
instruction word itself.  However, if you specify a branch target far
enough away that its address won't fit in 13 bits, the assembler can
either issue an error, or convert your Compare-and-Branch instruction
into separate instructions to do the compare and the branch.

   Whether `as' gives an error or expands the instruction depends on
two choices you can make: whether you use the `-no-relax' option, and
whether you use a "Compare and Branch" instruction or a "Compare and
Jump" instruction.  The "Jump" instructions are _always_ expanded if
necessary; the "Branch" instructions are expanded when necessary
_unless_ you specify `-no-relax'--in which case `as' gives an error
instead.

   These are the Compare-and-Branch instructions, their "Jump" variants,
and the instruction pairs they may expand into:

             Compare and
          Branch      Jump       Expanded to

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line, the whole line is
treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a logical
line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control
command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The `;' character can be used to separate statements on the same

File: as.info,  Node: IA-64 Options,  Next: IA-64 Syntax,  Up: IA-64-Dependent

9.18.1 Options
--------------

`-mconstant-gp'
     This option instructs the assembler to mark the resulting object
     file as using the "constant GP" model.  With this model, it is
     assumed that the entire program uses a single global pointer (GP)
     value.  Note that this option does not in any fashion affect the
     machine code emitted by the assembler.  All it does is turn on the
     EF_IA_64_CONS_GP flag in the ELF file header.

`-mauto-pic'
     This option instructs the assembler to mark the resulting object
     file as using the "constant GP without function descriptor" data
     model.  This model is like the "constant GP" model, except that it
     additionally does away with function descriptors.  What this means
     is that the address of a function refers directly to the
     function's code entry-point.  Normally, such an address would
     refer to a function descriptor, which contains both the code
     entry-point and the GP-value needed by the function.  Note that
     this option does not in any fashion affect the machine code
     emitted by the assembler.  All it does is turn on the
     EF_IA_64_NOFUNCDESC_CONS_GP flag in the ELF file header.

`-milp32'
`-milp64'
`-mlp64'
`-mp64'
     These options select the data model.  The assembler defaults to
     `-mlp64' (LP64 data model).

`-mle'
`-mbe'
     These options select the byte order.  The `-mle' option selects
     little-endian byte order (default) and `-mbe' selects big-endian
     byte order.  Note that IA-64 machine code always uses
     little-endian byte order.

`-mtune=itanium1'
`-mtune=itanium2'
     Tune for a particular IA-64 CPU, ITANIUM1 or ITANIUM2. The default
     is ITANIUM2.

`-munwind-check=warning'
`-munwind-check=error'
     These options control what the assembler will do when performing
     consistency checks on unwind directives.  `-munwind-check=warning'
     will make the assembler issue a warning when an unwind directive
     check fails.  This is the default.  `-munwind-check=error' will
     make the assembler issue an error when an unwind directive check
     fails.

`-mhint.b=ok'
`-mhint.b=warning'
`-mhint.b=error'
     These options control what the assembler will do when the `hint.b'
     instruction is used.  `-mhint.b=ok' will make the assembler accept
     `hint.b'.  `-mint.b=warning' will make the assembler issue a
     warning when `hint.b' is used.  `-mhint.b=error' will make the
     assembler treat `hint.b' as an error, which is the default.

`-x'
`-xexplicit'
     These options turn on dependency violation checking.

`-xauto'
     This option instructs the assembler to automatically insert stop
     bits where necessary to remove dependency violations.  This is the
     default mode.

`-xnone'
     This option turns off dependency violation checking.

`-xdebug'
     This turns on debug output intended to help tracking down bugs in
     the dependency violation checker.

`-xdebugn'
     This is a shortcut for -xnone -xdebug.

`-xdebugx'
     This is a shortcut for -xexplicit -xdebug.

9.18.2.2 Register Names
.......................

The 128 integer registers are referred to as `rN'.  The 128
floating-point registers are referred to as `fN'.  The 128 application
registers are referred to as `arN'.  The 128 control registers are
referred to as `crN'.  The 64 one-bit predicate registers are referred
to as `pN'.  The 8 branch registers are referred to as `bN'.  In
addition, the assembler defines a number of aliases: `gp' (`r1'), `sp'
(`r12'), `rp' (`b0'), `ret0' (`r8'), `ret1' (`r9'), `ret2' (`r10'),
`ret3' (`r9'), `fargN' (`f8+N'), and `fretN' (`f8+N').

   For convenience, the assembler also defines aliases for all named
application and control registers.  For example, `ar.bsp' refers to the
register backing store pointer (`ar17').  Similarly, `cr.eoi' refers to
the end-of-interrupt register (`cr67').

9.18.2.3 IA-64 Processor-Status-Register (PSR) Bit Names
........................................................

The assembler defines bit masks for each of the bits in the IA-64
processor status register.  For example, `psr.ic' corresponds to a
value of 0x2000.  These masks are primarily intended for use with the
`ssm'/`sum' and `rsm'/`rum' instructions, but they can be used anywhere
else where an integer constant is expected.

9.18.2.4 Relocations
....................

In addition to the standard IA-64 relocations, the following
relocations are implemented by `as':

`@slotcount(V)'
     Convert the address offset V into a slot count.  This pseudo
     function is available only on VMS.  The expression V must be known
     at assembly time: it can't reference undefined symbols or symbols
     in different sections.

9.20.2.2 Relocatable Expression Modifiers
.........................................

The assembler supports several modifiers when using relocatable
addresses in LM32 instruction operands.  The general syntax is the
following:

     modifier(relocatable-expression)

`lo'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 0 through 15 of an address
     expression as 16 bit relocatable expression.

`hi'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 16 through 23 of an address
     expression as 16 bit relocatable expression.

     For example

          ori  r4, r4, lo(sym+10)
          orhi r4, r4, hi(sym+10)

`gp'
     This modified creates a 16-bit relocatable expression that is the
     offset of the symbol from the global pointer.

          mva r4, gp(sym)

`got'
     This modifier places a symbol in the GOT and creates a 16-bit
     relocatable expression that is the offset into the GOT of this
     symbol.

          lw r4, (gp+got(sym))

`gotofflo16'
     This modifier allows you to use the bits 0 through 15 of an
     address which is an offset from the GOT.

`gotoffhi16'
     This modifier allows you to use the bits 16 through 31 of an
     address which is an offset from the GOT.

          orhi r4, r4, gotoffhi16(lsym)
          addi r4, r4, gotofflo16(lsym)

extends to the end of the current line.  Note that if a line starts
with a `#' character then it can also be a logical line number
directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control command (*note
Preprocessing::).

   A semicolon (`;') can be used to separate multiple statements on the
same line.

9.21 M32C Dependent Features
============================

   `as' can assemble code for several different members of the Renesas
M32C family.  Normally the default is to assemble code for the M16C
microprocessor.  The `-m32c' option may be used to change the default
to the M32C microprocessor.

`-m32c'
     Assemble M32C instructions.

`-m16c'
     Assemble M16C instructions (default).

`-relax'
     Enable support for link-time relaxations.

`-h-tick-hex'
     Support H'00 style hex constants in addition to 0x00 style.

9.21.2.1 Symbolic Operand Modifiers
...................................

The assembler supports several modifiers when using symbol addresses in
M32C instruction operands.  The general syntax is the following:

     %modifier(symbol)

`%dsp8'
`%dsp16'
     These modifiers override the assembler's assumptions about how big
     a symbol's address is.  Normally, when it sees an operand like
     `sym[a0]' it assumes `sym' may require the widest displacement
     field (16 bits for `-m16c', 24 bits for `-m32c').  These modifiers
     tell it to assume the address will fit in an 8 or 16 bit
     (respectively) unsigned displacement.  Note that, of course, if it
     doesn't actually fit you will get linker errors.  Example:

          mov.w %dsp8(sym)[a0],r1
          mov.b #0,%dsp8(sym)[a0]

`%hi8'
     This modifier allows you to load bits 16 through 23 of a 24 bit
     address into an 8 bit register.  This is useful with, for example,
     the M16C `smovf' instruction, which expects a 20 bit address in
     `r1h' and `a0'.  Example:

          mov.b #%hi8(sym),r1h
          mov.w #%lo16(sym),a0
          smovf.b

`%lo16'
     Likewise, this modifier allows you to load bits 0 through 15 of a
     24 bit address into a 16 bit register.

`%hi16'
     This modifier allows you to load bits 16 through 31 of a 32 bit
     address into a 16 bit register.  While the M32C family only has 24
     bits of address space, it does support addresses in pairs of 16 bit
     registers (like `a1a0' for the `lde' instruction).  This modifier
     is for loading the upper half in such cases.  Example:

          mov.w #%hi16(sym),a1
          mov.w #%lo16(sym),a0
          ...
          lde.w [a1a0],r1

9.21.2.2 Special Characters
...........................

The presence of a `;' character on a line indicates the start of a
comment that extends to the end of that line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line, the whole line is
treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a logical
line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control
command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The `|' character can be used to separate statements on the same
line.

9.22.1 M32R Options
-------------------

The Renesas M32R version of `as' has a few machine dependent options:

`-m32rx'
     `as' can assemble code for several different members of the
     Renesas M32R family.  Normally the default is to assemble code for
     the M32R microprocessor.  This option may be used to change the
     default to the M32RX microprocessor, which adds some more
     instructions to the basic M32R instruction set, and some
     additional parameters to some of the original instructions.

`-m32r2'
     This option changes the target processor to the M32R2
     microprocessor.

`-m32r'
     This option can be used to restore the assembler's default
     behaviour of assembling for the M32R microprocessor.  This can be
     useful if the default has been changed by a previous command line
     option.

`-little'
     This option tells the assembler to produce little-endian code and
     data.  The default is dependent upon how the toolchain was
     configured.

`-EL'
     This is a synonym for _-little_.

`-big'
     This option tells the assembler to produce big-endian code and
     data.

`-EB'
     This is a synonym for _-big_.

`-KPIC'
     This option specifies that the output of the assembler should be
     marked as position-independent code (PIC).

`-parallel'
     This option tells the assembler to attempts to combine two
     sequential instructions into a single, parallel instruction, where
     it is legal to do so.

`-no-parallel'
     This option disables a previously enabled _-parallel_ option.

`-no-bitinst'
     This option disables the support for the extended bit-field
     instructions provided by the M32R2.  If this support needs to be
     re-enabled the _-bitinst_ switch can be used to restore it.

`-O'
     This option tells the assembler to attempt to optimize the
     instructions that it produces.  This includes filling delay slots
     and converting sequential instructions into parallel ones.  This
     option implies _-parallel_.

`-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts'
     Instructs `as' to produce warning messages when questionable
     parallel instructions are encountered.  This option is enabled by
     default, but `gcc' disables it when it invokes `as' directly.
     Questionable instructions are those whose behaviour would be
     different if they were executed sequentially.  For example the
     code fragment `mv r1, r2 || mv r3, r1' produces a different result
     from `mv r1, r2 \n mv r3, r1' since the former moves r1 into r3
     and then r2 into r1, whereas the later moves r2 into r1 and r3.

`-Wp'
     This is a shorter synonym for the
     _-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts_ option.

`-no-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts'
     Instructs `as' not to produce warning messages when questionable
     parallel instructions are encountered.

`-Wnp'
     This is a shorter synonym for the
     _-no-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts_ option.

`-ignore-parallel-conflicts'
     This option tells the assembler's to stop checking parallel
     instructions for constraint violations.  This ability is provided
     for hardware vendors testing chip designs and should not be used
     under normal circumstances.

`-no-ignore-parallel-conflicts'
     This option restores the assembler's default behaviour of checking
     parallel instructions to detect constraint violations.

`-Ip'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-ignore-parallel-conflicts_
     option.

`-nIp'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-no-ignore-parallel-conflicts_
     option.

`-warn-unmatched-high'
     This option tells the assembler to produce a warning message if a
     `.high' pseudo op is encountered without a matching `.low' pseudo
     op.  The presence of such an unmatched pseudo op usually indicates
     a programming error.

`-no-warn-unmatched-high'
     Disables a previously enabled _-warn-unmatched-high_ option.

`-Wuh'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-warn-unmatched-high_ option.

`-Wnuh'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-no-warn-unmatched-high_ option.

9.22.2 M32R Directives
----------------------

The Renesas M32R version of `as' has a few architecture specific
directives:

`low EXPRESSION'
     The `low' directive computes the value of its expression and
     places the lower 16-bits of the result into the immediate-field of
     the instruction.  For example:

             or3   r0, r0, #low(0x12345678) ; compute r0 = r0 | 0x5678
             add3, r0, r0, #low(fred)   ; compute r0 = r0 + low 16-bits of address of fred

`high EXPRESSION'
     The `high' directive computes the value of its expression and
     places the upper 16-bits of the result into the immediate-field of
     the instruction.  For example:

             seth  r0, #high(0x12345678) ; compute r0 = 0x12340000
             seth, r0, #high(fred)       ; compute r0 = upper 16-bits of address of fred

`shigh EXPRESSION'
     The `shigh' directive is very similar to the `high' directive.  It
     also computes the value of its expression and places the upper
     16-bits of the result into the immediate-field of the instruction.
     The difference is that `shigh' also checks to see if the lower
     16-bits could be interpreted as a signed number, and if so it
     assumes that a borrow will occur from the upper-16 bits.  To
     compensate for this the `shigh' directive pre-biases the upper 16
     bit value by adding one to it.  For example:

     For example:

             seth  r0, #shigh(0x12345678) ; compute r0 = 0x12340000
             seth  r0, #shigh(0x00008000) ; compute r0 = 0x00010000

     In the second example the lower 16-bits are 0x8000.  If these are
     treated as a signed value and sign extended to 32-bits then the
     value becomes 0xffff8000.  If this value is then added to
     0x00010000 then the result is 0x00008000.

     This behaviour is to allow for the different semantics of the
     `or3' and `add3' instructions.  The `or3' instruction treats its
     16-bit immediate argument as unsigned whereas the `add3' treats
     its 16-bit immediate as a signed value.  So for example:

             seth  r0, #shigh(0x00008000)
             add3  r0, r0, #low(0x00008000)

     Produces the correct result in r0, whereas:

             seth  r0, #shigh(0x00008000)
             or3   r0, r0, #low(0x00008000)

     Stores 0xffff8000 into r0.

     Note - the `shigh' directive does not know where in the assembly
     source code the lower 16-bits of the value are going set, so it
     cannot check to make sure that an `or3' instruction is being used
     rather than an `add3' instruction.  It is up to the programmer to
     make sure that correct directives are used.

`.m32r'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-m32r_ command line
     option.  It tells the assembler to only accept M32R instructions
     from now on.  An instructions from later M32R architectures are
     refused.

`.m32rx'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-m32rx_ command
     line option.  It tells the assembler to start accepting the extra
     instructions in the M32RX ISA as well as the ordinary M32R ISA.

`.m32r2'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-m32r2_ command
     line option.  It tells the assembler to start accepting the extra
     instructions in the M32R2 ISA as well as the ordinary M32R ISA.

`.little'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-little_ command
     line option.  It tells the assembler to start producing
     little-endian code and data.  This option should be used with care
     as producing mixed-endian binary files is fraught with danger.

`.big'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-big_ command line
     option.  It tells the assembler to start producing big-endian code
     and data.  This option should be used with care as producing
     mixed-endian binary files is fraught with danger.

9.22.3 M32R Warnings
--------------------

There are several warning and error messages that can be produced by
`as' which are specific to the M32R:

`output of 1st instruction is the same as an input to 2nd instruction - is this intentional ?'
     This message is only produced if warnings for explicit parallel
     conflicts have been enabled.  It indicates that the assembler has
     encountered a parallel instruction in which the destination
     register of the left hand instruction is used as an input register
     in the right hand instruction.  For example in this code fragment
     `mv r1, r2 || neg r3, r1' register r1 is the destination of the
     move instruction and the input to the neg instruction.

`output of 2nd instruction is the same as an input to 1st instruction - is this intentional ?'
     This message is only produced if warnings for explicit parallel
     conflicts have been enabled.  It indicates that the assembler has
     encountered a parallel instruction in which the destination
     register of the right hand instruction is used as an input
     register in the left hand instruction.  For example in this code
     fragment `mv r1, r2 || neg r2, r3' register r2 is the destination
     of the neg instruction and the input to the move instruction.

`instruction `...' is for the M32RX only'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters an
     instruction which is only supported by the M32Rx processor, and
     the `-m32rx' command line flag has not been specified to allow
     assembly of such instructions.

`unknown instruction `...''
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters an
     instruction which it does not recognize.

`only the NOP instruction can be issued in parallel on the m32r'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction which does not involve a NOP instruction and the
     `-m32rx' command line flag has not been specified.  Only the M32Rx
     processor is able to execute two instructions in parallel.

`instruction `...' cannot be executed in parallel.'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction which is made up of one or two instructions which
     cannot be executed in parallel.

`Instructions share the same execution pipeline'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction whose components both use the same execution pipeline.

`Instructions write to the same destination register.'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction where both components attempt to modify the same
     register.  For example these code fragments will produce this
     message: `mv r1, r2 || neg r1, r3' `jl r0 || mv r14, r1' `st r2,
     @-r1 || mv r1, r3' `mv r1, r2 || ld r0, @r1+' `cmp r1, r2 || addx
     r3, r4' (Both write to the condition bit)

9.23.1 M680x0 Options
---------------------

The Motorola 680x0 version of `as' has a few machine dependent options:

`-march=ARCHITECTURE'
     This option specifies a target architecture.  The following
     architectures are recognized: `68000', `68010', `68020', `68030',
     `68040', `68060', `cpu32', `isaa', `isaaplus', `isab', `isac' and
     `cfv4e'.

`-mcpu=CPU'
     This option specifies a target cpu.  When used in conjunction with
     the `-march' option, the cpu must be within the specified
     architecture.  Also, the generic features of the architecture are
     used for instruction generation, rather than those of the specific
     chip.

`-m[no-]68851'
`-m[no-]68881'
`-m[no-]div'
`-m[no-]usp'
`-m[no-]float'
`-m[no-]mac'
`-m[no-]emac'
     Enable or disable various architecture specific features.  If a
     chip or architecture by default supports an option (for instance
     `-march=isaaplus' includes the `-mdiv' option), explicitly
     disabling the option will override the default.

`-l'
     You can use the `-l' option to shorten the size of references to
     undefined symbols.  If you do not use the `-l' option, references
     to undefined symbols are wide enough for a full `long' (32 bits).
     (Since `as' cannot know where these symbols end up, `as' can only
     allocate space for the linker to fill in later.  Since `as' does
     not know how far away these symbols are, it allocates as much
     space as it can.)  If you use this option, the references are only
     one word wide (16 bits).  This may be useful if you want the
     object file to be as small as possible, and you know that the
     relevant symbols are always less than 17 bits away.

`--register-prefix-optional'
     For some configurations, especially those where the compiler
     normally does not prepend an underscore to the names of user
     variables, the assembler requires a `%' before any use of a
     register name.  This is intended to let the assembler distinguish
     between C variables and functions named `a0' through `a7', and so
     on.  The `%' is always accepted, but is not required for certain
     configurations, notably `sun3'.  The `--register-prefix-optional'
     option may be used to permit omitting the `%' even for
     configurations for which it is normally required.  If this is
     done, it will generally be impossible to refer to C variables and
     functions with the same names as register names.

`--bitwise-or'
     Normally the character `|' is treated as a comment character, which
     means that it can not be used in expressions.  The `--bitwise-or'
     option turns `|' into a normal character.  In this mode, you must
     either use C style comments, or start comments with a `#' character
     at the beginning of a line.

`--base-size-default-16  --base-size-default-32'
     If you use an addressing mode with a base register without
     specifying the size, `as' will normally use the full 32 bit value.
     For example, the addressing mode `%a0@(%d0)' is equivalent to
     `%a0@(%d0:l)'.  You may use the `--base-size-default-16' option to
     tell `as' to default to using the 16 bit value.  In this case,
     `%a0@(%d0)' is equivalent to `%a0@(%d0:w)'.  You may use the
     `--base-size-default-32' option to restore the default behaviour.

`--disp-size-default-16  --disp-size-default-32'
     If you use an addressing mode with a displacement, and the value
     of the displacement is not known, `as' will normally assume that
     the value is 32 bits.  For example, if the symbol `disp' has not
     been defined, `as' will assemble the addressing mode
     `%a0@(disp,%d0)' as though `disp' is a 32 bit value.  You may use
     the `--disp-size-default-16' option to tell `as' to instead assume
     that the displacement is 16 bits.  In this case, `as' will
     assemble `%a0@(disp,%d0)' as though `disp' is a 16 bit value.  You
     may use the `--disp-size-default-32' option to restore the default
     behaviour.

`--pcrel'
     Always keep branches PC-relative.  In the M680x0 architecture all
     branches are defined as PC-relative.  However, on some processors
     they are limited to word displacements maximum.  When `as' needs a
     long branch that is not available, it normally emits an absolute
     jump instead.  This option disables this substitution.  When this
     option is given and no long branches are available, only word
     branches will be emitted.  An error message will be generated if a
     word branch cannot reach its target.  This option has no effect on
     68020 and other processors that have long branches.  *note Branch
     Improvement: M68K-Branch.

`-m68000'
     `as' can assemble code for several different members of the
     Motorola 680x0 family.  The default depends upon how `as' was
     configured when it was built; normally, the default is to assemble
     code for the 68020 microprocessor.  The following options may be
     used to change the default.  These options control which
     instructions and addressing modes are permitted.  The members of
     the 680x0 family are very similar.  For detailed information about
     the differences, see the Motorola manuals.

    `-m68000'
    `-m68ec000'
    `-m68hc000'
    `-m68hc001'
    `-m68008'

    `-m68307'
    `-m68322'
    `-m68356'
          Assemble for the 68000. `-m68008', `-m68302', and so on are
          synonyms for `-m68000', since the chips are the same from the
          point of view of the assembler.

    `-m68010'
          Assemble for the 68010.

    `-m68020'
    `-m68ec020'

9.23.2 Syntax
-------------

This syntax for the Motorola 680x0 was developed at MIT.

   The 680x0 version of `as' uses instructions names and syntax
compatible with the Sun assembler.  Intervening periods are ignored;
for example, `movl' is equivalent to `mov.l'.

   In the following table APC stands for any of the address registers
(`%a0' through `%a7'), the program counter (`%pc'), the zero-address
relative to the program counter (`%zpc'), a suppressed address register
(`%za0' through `%za7'), or it may be omitted entirely.  The use of
SIZE means one of `w' or `l', and it may be omitted, along with the
leading colon, unless a scale is also specified.  The use of SCALE
means one of `1', `2', `4', or `8', and it may always be omitted along
with the leading colon.

   The following addressing modes are understood:
"Immediate"
     `#NUMBER'

"Data Register"
     `%d0' through `%d7'

"Address Register"
     `%a0' through `%a7'
     `%a7' is also known as `%sp', i.e., the Stack Pointer.  `%a6' is
     also known as `%fp', the Frame Pointer.

"Address Register Indirect"
     `%a0@' through `%a7@'

"Address Register Postincrement"
     `%a0@+' through `%a7@+'

"Address Register Predecrement"
     `%a0@-' through `%a7@-'

"Indirect Plus Offset"
     `APC@(NUMBER)'

"Index"
     `APC@(NUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted.

"Postindex"
     `APC@(NUMBER)@(ONUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)'

     The ONUMBER or the REGISTER, but not both, may be omitted.

"Preindex"
     `APC@(NUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)@(ONUMBER)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted.  Omitting the REGISTER produces the
     Postindex addressing mode.

"Absolute"
     `SYMBOL', or `DIGITS', optionally followed by `:b', `:w', or `:l'.

9.23.3 Motorola Syntax
----------------------

The standard Motorola syntax for this chip differs from the syntax
already discussed (*note Syntax: M68K-Syntax.).  `as' can accept
Motorola syntax for operands, even if MIT syntax is used for other
operands in the same instruction.  The two kinds of syntax are fully
compatible.

   In the following table APC stands for any of the address registers
(`%a0' through `%a7'), the program counter (`%pc'), the zero-address
relative to the program counter (`%zpc'), or a suppressed address
register (`%za0' through `%za7').  The use of SIZE means one of `w' or
`l', and it may always be omitted along with the leading dot.  The use
of SCALE means one of `1', `2', `4', or `8', and it may always be
omitted along with the leading asterisk.

   The following additional addressing modes are understood:

"Address Register Indirect"
     `(%a0)' through `(%a7)'
     `%a7' is also known as `%sp', i.e., the Stack Pointer.  `%a6' is
     also known as `%fp', the Frame Pointer.

"Address Register Postincrement"
     `(%a0)+' through `(%a7)+'

"Address Register Predecrement"
     `-(%a0)' through `-(%a7)'

"Indirect Plus Offset"
     `NUMBER(%A0)' through `NUMBER(%A7)', or `NUMBER(%PC)'.

     The NUMBER may also appear within the parentheses, as in
     `(NUMBER,%A0)'.  When used with the PC, the NUMBER may be omitted
     (with an address register, omitting the NUMBER produces Address
     Register Indirect mode).

"Index"
     `NUMBER(APC,REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted, or it may appear within the
     parentheses.  The APC may be omitted.  The REGISTER and the APC
     may appear in either order.  If both APC and REGISTER are address
     registers, and the SIZE and SCALE are omitted, then the first
     register is taken as the base register, and the second as the
     index register.

"Postindex"
     `([NUMBER,APC],REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE,ONUMBER)'

     The ONUMBER, or the REGISTER, or both, may be omitted.  Either the
     NUMBER or the APC may be omitted, but not both.

"Preindex"
     `([NUMBER,APC,REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE],ONUMBER)'

     The NUMBER, or the APC, or the REGISTER, or any two of them, may
     be omitted.  The ONUMBER may be omitted.  The REGISTER and the APC
     may appear in either order.  If both APC and REGISTER are address
     registers, and the SIZE and SCALE are omitted, then the first
     register is taken as the base register, and the second as the
     index register.

Packed decimal (P) format floating literals are not supported.  Feel
free to add the code!

   The floating point formats generated by directives are these.

`.float'
     `Single' precision floating point constants.

`.double'
     `Double' precision floating point constants.

`.extend'
`.ldouble'
     `Extended' precision (`long double') floating point constants.

9.23.5 680x0 Machine Directives
-------------------------------

In order to be compatible with the Sun assembler the 680x0 assembler
understands the following directives.

`.data1'
     This directive is identical to a `.data 1' directive.

`.data2'
     This directive is identical to a `.data 2' directive.

`.even'
     This directive is a special case of the `.align' directive; it
     aligns the output to an even byte boundary.

`.skip'
     This directive is identical to a `.space' directive.

`.arch NAME'
     Select the target architecture and extension features.  Valid
     values for NAME are the same as for the `-march' command line
     option.  This directive cannot be specified after any instructions
     have been assembled.  If it is given multiple times, or in
     conjunction with the `-march' option, all uses must be for the
     same architecture and extension set.

`.cpu NAME'
     Select the target cpu.  Valid values for NAME are the same as for
     the `-mcpu' command line option.  This directive cannot be
     specified after any instructions have been assembled.  If it is
     given multiple times, or in conjunction with the `-mopt' option,
     all uses must be for the same cpu.

9.23.6.1 Branch Improvement
...........................

Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted for branch instructions.  They
expand to the shortest branch instruction that reach the target.
Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting `j' for `b' at the
start of a Motorola mnemonic.

   The following table summarizes the pseudo-operations.  A `*' flags
cases that are more fully described after the table:

               Displacement
               +------------------------------------------------------------
               |                68020           68000/10, not PC-relative OK
     Pseudo-Op |BYTE    WORD    LONG            ABSOLUTE LONG JUMP    **
               +------------------------------------------------------------
          jbsr |bsrs    bsrw    bsrl            jsr
           jra |bras    braw    bral            jmp
     *     jXX |bXXs    bXXw    bXXl            bNXs;jmp
     *    dbXX | N/A    dbXXw   dbXX;bras;bral  dbXX;bras;jmp
          fjXX | N/A    fbXXw   fbXXl            N/A

     XX: condition
     NX: negative of condition XX
                       `*'--see full description below
         `**'--this expansion mode is disallowed by `--pcrel'

`jbsr'
`jra'
     These are the simplest jump pseudo-operations; they always map to
     one particular machine instruction, depending on the displacement
     to the branch target.  This instruction will be a byte or word
     branch is that is sufficient.  Otherwise, a long branch will be
     emitted if available.  If no long branches are available and the
     `--pcrel' option is not given, an absolute long jump will be
     emitted instead.  If no long branches are available, the `--pcrel'
     option is given, and a word branch cannot reach the target, an
     error message is generated.

     In addition to standard branch operands, `as' allows these
     pseudo-operations to have all operands that are allowed for jsr
     and jmp, substituting these instructions if the operand given is
     not valid for a branch instruction.

`jXX'
     Here, `jXX' stands for an entire family of pseudo-operations,
     where XX is a conditional branch or condition-code test.  The full
     list of pseudo-ops in this family is:
           jhi   jls   jcc   jcs   jne   jeq   jvc
           jvs   jpl   jmi   jge   jlt   jgt   jle

     Usually, each of these pseudo-operations expands to a single branch
     instruction.  However, if a word branch is not sufficient, no long
     branches are available, and the `--pcrel' option is not given, `as'
     issues a longer code fragment in terms of NX, the opposite
     condition to XX.  For example, under these conditions:
              jXX foo
     gives
               bNXs oof
               jmp foo
           oof:

`dbXX'
     The full family of pseudo-operations covered here is
           dbhi   dbls   dbcc   dbcs   dbne   dbeq   dbvc
           dbvs   dbpl   dbmi   dbge   dblt   dbgt   dble
           dbf    dbra   dbt

     Motorola `dbXX' instructions allow word displacements only.  When
     a word displacement is sufficient, each of these pseudo-operations
     expands to the corresponding Motorola instruction.  When a word
     displacement is not sufficient and long branches are available,
     when the source reads `dbXX foo', `as' emits
               dbXX oo1
               bras oo2
           oo1:bral foo
           oo2:

     If, however, long branches are not available and the `--pcrel'
     option is not given, `as' emits
               dbXX oo1
               bras oo2
           oo1:jmp foo
           oo2:

`fjXX'
     This family includes
           fjne   fjeq   fjge   fjlt   fjgt   fjle   fjf
           fjt    fjgl   fjgle  fjnge  fjngl  fjngle fjngt
           fjnle  fjnlt  fjoge  fjogl  fjogt  fjole  fjolt
           fjor   fjseq  fjsf   fjsne  fjst   fjueq  fjuge
           fjugt  fjule  fjult  fjun

     Each of these pseudo-operations always expands to a single Motorola
     coprocessor branch instruction, word or long.  All Motorola
     coprocessor branch instructions allow both word and long
     displacements.

9.23.6.2 Special Characters
...........................

Line comments are introduced by the `|' character appearing anywhere on
a line, unless the `--bitwise-or' command line option has been
specified.

   An asterisk (`*') as the first character on a line marks the start
of a line comment as well.

   A hash character (`#') as the first character on a line also marks
the start of a line comment, but in this case it could also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).  If the hash character appears
elsewhere on a line it is used to introduce an immediate value.  (This
is for compatibility with Sun's assembler).

   Multiple statements on the same line can appear if they are separated
by the `;' character.

9.24.1 M68HC11 and M68HC12 Options
----------------------------------

The Motorola 68HC11 and 68HC12 version of `as' have a few machine
dependent options.

`-m68hc11'
     This option switches the assembler into the M68HC11 mode. In this
     mode, the assembler only accepts 68HC11 operands and mnemonics. It
     produces code for the 68HC11.

`-m68hc12'
     This option switches the assembler into the M68HC12 mode. In this
     mode, the assembler also accepts 68HC12 operands and mnemonics. It
     produces code for the 68HC12. A few 68HC11 instructions are
     replaced by some 68HC12 instructions as recommended by Motorola
     specifications.

`-m68hcs12'
     This option switches the assembler into the M68HCS12 mode.  This
     mode is similar to `-m68hc12' but specifies to assemble for the
     68HCS12 series.  The only difference is on the assembling of the
     `movb' and `movw' instruction when a PC-relative operand is used.

`-mm9s12x'
     This option switches the assembler into the M9S12X mode.  This
     mode is similar to `-m68hc12' but specifies to assemble for the
     S12X series which is a superset of the HCS12.

`-mm9s12xg'
     This option switches the assembler into the XGATE mode for the RISC
     co-processor featured on some S12X-family chips.

`--xgate-ramoffset'
     This option instructs the linker to offset RAM addresses from S12X
     address space into XGATE address space.

`-mshort'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 16-bit integer
     ABI.  It has no effect on the assembled instructions.  This is the
     default.

`-mlong'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit integer
     ABI.

`-mshort-double'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit float
     ABI.  This is the default.

`-mlong-double'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 64-bit float
     ABI.

`--strict-direct-mode'
     You can use the `--strict-direct-mode' option to disable the
     automatic translation of direct page mode addressing into extended
     mode when the instruction does not support direct mode.  For
     example, the `clr' instruction does not support direct page mode
     addressing. When it is used with the direct page mode, `as' will
     ignore it and generate an absolute addressing.  This option
     prevents `as' from doing this, and the wrong usage of the direct
     page mode will raise an error.

`--short-branches'
     The `--short-branches' option turns off the translation of
     relative branches into absolute branches when the branch offset is
     out of range. By default `as' transforms the relative branch
     (`bsr', `bgt', `bge', `beq', `bne', `ble', `blt', `bhi', `bcc',
     `bls', `bcs', `bmi', `bvs', `bvs', `bra') into an absolute branch
     when the offset is out of the -128 .. 127 range.  In that case,
     the `bsr' instruction is translated into a `jsr', the `bra'
     instruction is translated into a `jmp' and the conditional
     branches instructions are inverted and followed by a `jmp'. This
     option disables these translations and `as' will generate an error
     if a relative branch is out of range. This option does not affect
     the optimization associated to the `jbra', `jbsr' and `jbXX'
     pseudo opcodes.

`--force-long-branches'
     The `--force-long-branches' option forces the translation of
     relative branches into absolute branches. This option does not
     affect the optimization associated to the `jbra', `jbsr' and
     `jbXX' pseudo opcodes.

`--print-insn-syntax'
     You can use the `--print-insn-syntax' option to obtain the syntax
     description of the instruction when an error is detected.

`--print-opcodes'
     The `--print-opcodes' option prints the list of all the
     instructions with their syntax. The first item of each line
     represents the instruction name and the rest of the line indicates
     the possible operands for that instruction. The list is printed in
     alphabetical order. Once the list is printed `as' exits.

`--generate-example'
     The `--generate-example' option is similar to `--print-opcodes'
     but it generates an example for each instruction instead.

9.24.2 Syntax
-------------

In the M68HC11 syntax, the instruction name comes first and it may be
followed by one or several operands (up to three). Operands are
separated by comma (`,'). In the normal mode, `as' will complain if too
many operands are specified for a given instruction. In the MRI mode
(turned on with `-M' option), it will treat them as comments. Example:

     inx
     lda  #23
     bset 2,x #4
     brclr *bot #8 foo

   The presence of a `;' character or a `!' character anywhere on a
line indicates the start of a comment that extends to the end of that
line.

   A `*' or a `#' character at the start of a line also introduces a
line comment, but these characters do not work elsewhere on the line.
If the first character of the line is a `#' then as well as starting a
comment, the line could also be logical line number directive (*note
Comments::) or a preprocessor control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The M68HC11 assembler does not currently support a line separator
character.

   The following addressing modes are understood for 68HC11 and 68HC12:
"Immediate"
     `#NUMBER'

"Address Register"
     `NUMBER,X', `NUMBER,Y'

     The NUMBER may be omitted in which case 0 is assumed.

"Direct Addressing mode"
     `*SYMBOL', or `*DIGITS'

"Absolute"
     `SYMBOL', or `DIGITS'

   The M68HC12 has other more complex addressing modes. All of them are
supported and they are represented below:

"Constant Offset Indexed Addressing Mode"
     `NUMBER,REG'

     The NUMBER may be omitted in which case 0 is assumed.  The
     register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.  The assembler will
     use the smaller post-byte definition according to the constant
     value (5-bit constant offset, 9-bit constant offset or 16-bit
     constant offset).  If the constant is not known by the assembler
     it will use the 16-bit constant offset post-byte and the value
     will be resolved at link time.

"Offset Indexed Indirect"
     `[NUMBER,REG]'

     The register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.

"Auto Pre-Increment/Pre-Decrement/Post-Increment/Post-Decrement"
     `NUMBER,-REG' `NUMBER,+REG' `NUMBER,REG-' `NUMBER,REG+'

     The number must be in the range `-8'..`+8' and must not be 0.  The
     register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.

"Accumulator Offset"
     `ACC,REG'

     The accumulator register can be either `A', `B' or `D'.  The
     register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.

"Accumulator D offset indexed-indirect"
     `[D,REG]'

     The register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.


   For example:

     ldab 1024,sp
     ldd [10,x]
     orab 3,+x
     stab -2,y-
     ldx a,pc
     sty [d,sp]

9.24.3 Symbolic Operand Modifiers
---------------------------------

The assembler supports several modifiers when using symbol addresses in
68HC11 and 68HC12 instruction operands.  The general syntax is the
following:

     %modifier(symbol)

`%addr'
     This modifier indicates to the assembler and linker to use the
     16-bit physical address corresponding to the symbol.  This is
     intended to be used on memory window systems to map a symbol in
     the memory bank window.  If the symbol is in a memory expansion
     part, the physical address corresponds to the symbol address
     within the memory bank window.  If the symbol is not in a memory
     expansion part, this is the symbol address (using or not using the
     %addr modifier has no effect in that case).

`%page'
     This modifier indicates to use the memory page number corresponding
     to the symbol.  If the symbol is in a memory expansion part, its
     page number is computed by the linker as a number used to map the
     page containing the symbol in the memory bank window.  If the
     symbol is not in a memory expansion part, the page number is 0.

`%hi'
     This modifier indicates to use the 8-bit high part of the physical
     address of the symbol.

`%lo'
     This modifier indicates to use the 8-bit low part of the physical
     address of the symbol.


   For example a 68HC12 call to a function `foo_example' stored in
memory expansion part could be written as follows:

     call %addr(foo_example),%page(foo_example)

   and this is equivalent to

     call foo_example

   And for 68HC11 it could be written as follows:

     ldab #%page(foo_example)
     stab _page_switch
     jsr  %addr(foo_example)

9.24.4 Assembler Directives
---------------------------

The 68HC11 and 68HC12 version of `as' have the following specific
assembler directives:

`.relax'
     The relax directive is used by the `GNU Compiler' to emit a
     specific relocation to mark a group of instructions for linker
     relaxation.  The sequence of instructions within the group must be
     known to the linker so that relaxation can be performed.

`.mode [mshort|mlong|mshort-double|mlong-double]'
     This directive specifies the ABI.  It overrides the `-mshort',
     `-mlong', `-mshort-double' and `-mlong-double' options.

`.far SYMBOL'
     This directive marks the symbol as a `far' symbol meaning that it
     uses a `call/rtc' calling convention as opposed to `jsr/rts'.
     During a final link, the linker will identify references to the
     `far' symbol and will verify the proper calling convention.

`.interrupt SYMBOL'
     This directive marks the symbol as an interrupt entry point.  This
     information is then used by the debugger to correctly unwind the
     frame across interrupts.

`.xrefb SYMBOL'
     This directive is defined for compatibility with the
     `Specification for Motorola 8 and 16-Bit Assembly Language Input
     Standard' and is ignored.

9.24.5 Floating Point
---------------------

Packed decimal (P) format floating literals are not supported.  Feel
free to add the code!

   The floating point formats generated by directives are these.

`.float'
     `Single' precision floating point constants.

`.double'
     `Double' precision floating point constants.

`.extend'
`.ldouble'
     `Extended' precision (`long double') floating point constants.

9.24.6.1 Branch Improvement
...........................

Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted for branch instructions.  They
expand to the shortest branch instruction that reach the target.
Generally these mnemonics are made by prepending `j' to the start of
Motorola mnemonic. These pseudo opcodes are not affected by the
`--short-branches' or `--force-long-branches' options.

   The following table summarizes the pseudo-operations.

     XX: condition
     NX: negative of condition XX

`jbsr'
`jbra'
     These are the simplest jump pseudo-operations; they always map to
     one particular machine instruction, depending on the displacement
     to the branch target.

`jbXX'
     Here, `jbXX' stands for an entire family of pseudo-operations,
     where XX is a conditional branch or condition-code test.  The full
     list of pseudo-ops in this family is:
           jbcc   jbeq   jbge   jbgt   jbhi   jbvs   jbpl  jblo
           jbcs   jbne   jblt   jble   jbls   jbvc   jbmi

     For the cases of non-PC relative displacements and long
     displacements, `as' issues a longer code fragment in terms of NX,
     the opposite condition to XX.  For example, for the non-PC
     relative case:
              jbXX foo
     gives
               bNXs oof
               jmp foo

9.27.1 Assembler options
------------------------

The MIPS configurations of GNU `as' support these special options:

`-G NUM'
     Set the "small data" limit to N bytes.  The default limit is 8
     bytes.  *Note Controlling the use of small data accesses: MIPS
     Small Data.

`-EB'
`-EL'
     Any MIPS configuration of `as' can select big-endian or
     little-endian output at run time (unlike the other GNU development
     tools, which must be configured for one or the other).  Use `-EB'
     to select big-endian output, and `-EL' for little-endian.

`-KPIC'
     Generate SVR4-style PIC.  This option tells the assembler to
     generate SVR4-style position-independent macro expansions.  It
     also tells the assembler to mark the output file as PIC.

`-mvxworks-pic'
     Generate VxWorks PIC.  This option tells the assembler to generate
     VxWorks-style position-independent macro expansions.

`-mips1'
`-mips2'
`-mips3'
`-mips4'
`-mips5'
`-mips32'
`-mips32r2'
`-mips32r3'
`-mips32r5'
`-mips32r6'
`-mips64'
`-mips64r2'
`-mips64r3'
`-mips64r5'
`-mips64r6'
     Generate code for a particular MIPS Instruction Set Architecture
     level.  `-mips1' corresponds to the R2000 and R3000 processors,
     `-mips2' to the R6000 processor, `-mips3' to the R4000 processor,
     and `-mips4' to the R8000 and R10000 processors.  `-mips5',
     `-mips32', `-mips32r2', `-mips32r3', `-mips32r5', `-mips32r6',
     `-mips64', `-mips64r2', `-mips64r3', `-mips64r5', and `-mips64r6'
     correspond to generic MIPS V, MIPS32, MIPS32 Release 2, MIPS32
     Release 3, MIPS32 Release 5, MIPS32 Release 6, MIPS64, and MIPS64
     Release 2, MIPS64 Release 3, MIPS64 Release 5, and MIPS64 Release
     6 ISA processors, respectively.  You can also switch instruction
     sets during the assembly; see *Note Directives to override the ISA
     level: MIPS ISA.

`-mgp32'
`-mfp32'
     Some macros have different expansions for 32-bit and 64-bit
     registers.  The register sizes are normally inferred from the ISA
     and ABI, but these flags force a certain group of registers to be
     treated as 32 bits wide at all times.  `-mgp32' controls the size
     of general-purpose registers and `-mfp32' controls the size of
     floating-point registers.

     The `.set gp=32' and `.set fp=32' directives allow the size of
     registers to be changed for parts of an object. The default value
     is restored by `.set gp=default' and `.set fp=default'.

     On some MIPS variants there is a 32-bit mode flag; when this flag
     is set, 64-bit instructions generate a trap.  Also, some 32-bit
     OSes only save the 32-bit registers on a context switch, so it is
     essential never to use the 64-bit registers.

`-mgp64'
`-mfp64'
     Assume that 64-bit registers are available.  This is provided in
     the interests of symmetry with `-mgp32' and `-mfp32'.

     The `.set gp=64' and `.set fp=64' directives allow the size of
     registers to be changed for parts of an object. The default value
     is restored by `.set gp=default' and `.set fp=default'.

`-mfpxx'
     Make no assumptions about whether 32-bit or 64-bit floating-point
     registers are available. This is provided to support having modules
     compatible with either `-mfp32' or `-mfp64'. This option can only
     be used with MIPS II and above.

     The `.set fp=xx' directive allows a part of an object to be marked
     as not making assumptions about 32-bit or 64-bit FP registers.  The
     default value is restored by `.set fp=default'.

`-modd-spreg'
`-mno-odd-spreg'
     Enable use of floating-point operations on odd-numbered
     single-precision registers when supported by the ISA.  `-mfpxx'
     implies `-mno-odd-spreg', otherwise the default is `-modd-spreg'

`-mips16'
`-no-mips16'
     Generate code for the MIPS 16 processor.  This is equivalent to
     putting `.module mips16' at the start of the assembly file.
     `-no-mips16' turns off this option.

`-mmips16e2'
`-mno-mips16e2'
     Enable the use of MIPS16e2 instructions in MIPS16 mode.  This is
     equivalent to putting `.module mips16e2' at the start of the
     assembly file.  `-mno-mips16e2' turns off this option.

`-mmicromips'
`-mno-micromips'
     Generate code for the microMIPS processor.  This is equivalent to
     putting `.module micromips' at the start of the assembly file.
     `-mno-micromips' turns off this option.  This is equivalent to
     putting `.module nomicromips' at the start of the assembly file.

`-msmartmips'
`-mno-smartmips'
     Enables the SmartMIPS extensions to the MIPS32 instruction set,
     which provides a number of new instructions which target smartcard
     and cryptographic applications.  This is equivalent to putting
     `.module smartmips' at the start of the assembly file.
     `-mno-smartmips' turns off this option.

`-mips3d'
`-no-mips3d'
     Generate code for the MIPS-3D Application Specific Extension.
     This tells the assembler to accept MIPS-3D instructions.
     `-no-mips3d' turns off this option.

`-mdmx'
`-no-mdmx'
     Generate code for the MDMX Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MDMX instructions.  `-no-mdmx' turns
     off this option.

`-mdsp'
`-mno-dsp'
     Generate code for the DSP Release 1 Application Specific Extension.
     This tells the assembler to accept DSP Release 1 instructions.
     `-mno-dsp' turns off this option.

`-mdspr2'
`-mno-dspr2'
     Generate code for the DSP Release 2 Application Specific Extension.
     This option implies `-mdsp'.  This tells the assembler to accept
     DSP Release 2 instructions.  `-mno-dspr2' turns off this option.

`-mdspr3'
`-mno-dspr3'
     Generate code for the DSP Release 3 Application Specific Extension.
     This option implies `-mdsp' and `-mdspr2'.  This tells the
     assembler to accept DSP Release 3 instructions.  `-mno-dspr3'
     turns off this option.

`-mmt'
`-mno-mt'
     Generate code for the MT Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MT instructions.  `-mno-mt' turns
     off this option.

`-mmcu'
`-mno-mcu'
     Generate code for the MCU Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MCU instructions.  `-mno-mcu' turns
     off this option.

`-mmsa'
`-mno-msa'
     Generate code for the MIPS SIMD Architecture Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MSA instructions.  `-mno-msa' turns
     off this option.

`-mxpa'
`-mno-xpa'
     Generate code for the MIPS eXtended Physical Address (XPA)
     Extension.  This tells the assembler to accept XPA instructions.
     `-mno-xpa' turns off this option.

`-mvirt'
`-mno-virt'
     Generate code for the Virtualization Application Specific
     Extension.  This tells the assembler to accept Virtualization
     instructions.  `-mno-virt' turns off this option.

`-minsn32'
`-mno-insn32'
     Only use 32-bit instruction encodings when generating code for the
     microMIPS processor.  This option inhibits the use of any 16-bit
     instructions.  This is equivalent to putting `.set insn32' at the
     start of the assembly file.  `-mno-insn32' turns off this option.
     This is equivalent to putting `.set noinsn32' at the start of the
     assembly file.  By default `-mno-insn32' is selected, allowing all
     instructions to be used.

`-mfix7000'
`-mno-fix7000'
     Cause nops to be inserted if the read of the destination register
     of an mfhi or mflo instruction occurs in the following two
     instructions.

`-mfix-rm7000'
`-mno-fix-rm7000'
     Cause nops to be inserted if a dmult or dmultu instruction is
     followed by a load instruction.

`-mfix-loongson2f-jump'
`-mno-fix-loongson2f-jump'
     Eliminate instruction fetch from outside 256M region to work
     around the Loongson2F `jump' instructions.  Without it, under
     extreme cases, the kernel may crash.  The issue has been solved in
     latest processor batches, but this fix has no side effect to them.

`-mfix-loongson2f-nop'
`-mno-fix-loongson2f-nop'
     Replace nops by `or at,at,zero' to work around the Loongson2F
     `nop' errata.  Without it, under extreme cases, the CPU might
     deadlock.  The issue has been solved in later Loongson2F batches,
     but this fix has no side effect to them.

`-mfix-vr4120'
`-mno-fix-vr4120'
     Insert nops to work around certain VR4120 errata.  This option is
     intended to be used on GCC-generated code: it is not designed to
     catch all problems in hand-written assembler code.

`-mfix-vr4130'
`-mno-fix-vr4130'
     Insert nops to work around the VR4130 `mflo'/`mfhi' errata.

`-mfix-24k'
`-mno-fix-24k'
     Insert nops to work around the 24K `eret'/`deret' errata.

`-mfix-cn63xxp1'
`-mno-fix-cn63xxp1'
     Replace `pref' hints 0 - 4 and 6 - 24 with hint 28 to work around
     certain CN63XXP1 errata.

`-m4010'
`-no-m4010'
     Generate code for the LSI R4010 chip.  This tells the assembler to
     accept the R4010-specific instructions (`addciu', `ffc', etc.),
     and to not schedule `nop' instructions around accesses to the `HI'
     and `LO' registers.  `-no-m4010' turns off this option.

`-m4650'
`-no-m4650'
     Generate code for the MIPS R4650 chip.  This tells the assembler
     to accept the `mad' and `madu' instruction, and to not schedule
     `nop' instructions around accesses to the `HI' and `LO' registers.
     `-no-m4650' turns off this option.

`-m3900'
`-no-m3900'
`-m4100'
`-no-m4100'
     For each option `-mNNNN', generate code for the MIPS RNNNN chip.
     This tells the assembler to accept instructions specific to that
     chip, and to schedule for that chip's hazards.

`-march=CPU'
     Generate code for a particular MIPS CPU.  It is exactly equivalent
     to `-mCPU', except that there are more value of CPU understood.
     Valid CPU value are:

          2000, 3000, 3900, 4000, 4010, 4100, 4111, vr4120, vr4130,

     For compatibility reasons, `Nx' and `Bfx' are accepted as synonyms
     for `Nf1_1'.  These values are deprecated.

`-mtune=CPU'
     Schedule and tune for a particular MIPS CPU.  Valid CPU values are
     identical to `-march=CPU'.

`-mabi=ABI'
     Record which ABI the source code uses.  The recognized arguments
     are: `32', `n32', `o64', `64' and `eabi'.

`-msym32'
`-mno-sym32'
     Equivalent to adding `.set sym32' or `.set nosym32' to the
     beginning of the assembler input.  *Note MIPS Symbol Sizes::.

`-nocpp'
     This option is ignored.  It is accepted for command-line
     compatibility with other assemblers, which use it to turn off C
     style preprocessing.  With GNU `as', there is no need for
     `-nocpp', because the GNU assembler itself never runs the C
     preprocessor.

`-msoft-float'
`-mhard-float'
     Disable or enable floating-point instructions.  Note that by
     default floating-point instructions are always allowed even with
     CPU targets that don't have support for these instructions.

`-msingle-float'
`-mdouble-float'
     Disable or enable double-precision floating-point operations.  Note
     that by default double-precision floating-point operations are
     always allowed even with CPU targets that don't have support for
     these operations.

`--construct-floats'
`--no-construct-floats'
     The `--no-construct-floats' option disables the construction of
     double width floating point constants by loading the two halves of
     the value into the two single width floating point registers that
     make up the double width register.  This feature is useful if the
     processor support the FR bit in its status  register, and this bit
     is known (by the programmer) to be set.  This bit prevents the
     aliasing of the double width register by the single width
     registers.

     By default `--construct-floats' is selected, allowing construction
     of these floating point constants.

`--relax-branch'
`--no-relax-branch'
     The `--relax-branch' option enables the relaxation of out-of-range
     branches.  Any branches whose target cannot be reached directly are
     converted to a small instruction sequence including an
     inverse-condition branch to the physically next instruction, and a
     jump to the original target is inserted between the two
     instructions.  In PIC code the jump will involve further
     instructions for address calculation.

     The `BC1ANY2F', `BC1ANY2T', `BC1ANY4F', `BC1ANY4T', `BPOSGE32' and
     `BPOSGE64' instructions are excluded from relaxation, because they
     have no complementing counterparts.  They could be relaxed with
     the use of a longer sequence involving another branch, however
     this has not been implemented and if their target turns out of
     reach, they produce an error even if branch relaxation is enabled.

     Also no MIPS16 branches are ever relaxed.

     By default `--no-relax-branch' is selected, causing any
     out-of-range branches to produce an error.

`-mignore-branch-isa'
`-mno-ignore-branch-isa'
     Ignore branch checks for invalid transitions between ISA modes.

     The semantics of branches does not provide for an ISA mode switch,
     so in most cases the ISA mode a branch has been encoded for has to
     be the same as the ISA mode of the branch's target label.  If the
     ISA modes do not match, then such a branch, if taken, will cause
     the ISA mode to remain unchanged and instructions that follow will
     be executed in the wrong ISA mode causing the program to misbehave
     or crash.

     In the case of the `BAL' instruction it may be possible to relax
     it to an equivalent `JALX' instruction so that the ISA mode is
     switched at the run time as required.  For other branches no
     relaxation is possible and therefore GAS has checks implemented
     that verify in branch assembly that the two ISA modes match, and
     report an error otherwise so that the problem with code can be
     diagnosed at the assembly time rather than at the run time.

     However some assembly code, including generated code produced by
     some versions of GCC, may incorrectly include branches to data
     labels, which appear to require a mode switch but are either dead
     or immediately followed by valid instructions encoded for the same
     ISA the branch has been encoded for.  While not strictly correct
     at the source level such code will execute as intended, so to help
     with these cases `-mignore-branch-isa' is supported which disables
     ISA mode checks for branches.

     By default `-mno-ignore-branch-isa' is selected, causing any
     invalid branch requiring a transition between ISA modes to produce
     an error.

`-mnan=ENCODING'
     This option indicates whether the source code uses the IEEE 2008
     NaN encoding (`-mnan=2008') or the original MIPS encoding
     (`-mnan=legacy').  It is equivalent to adding a `.nan' directive
     to the beginning of the source file.  *Note MIPS NaN Encodings::.

     `-mnan=legacy' is the default if no `-mnan' option or `.nan'
     directive is used.

`--trap'
`--no-break'
     `as' automatically macro expands certain division and
     multiplication instructions to check for overflow and division by
     zero.  This option causes `as' to generate code to take a trap
     exception rather than a break exception when an error is detected.
     The trap instructions are only supported at Instruction Set
     Architecture level 2 and higher.

`--break'
`--no-trap'
     Generate code to take a break exception rather than a trap
     exception when an error is detected.  This is the default.

`-mpdr'
`-mno-pdr'
     Control generation of `.pdr' sections.  Off by default on IRIX, on
     elsewhere.

`-mshared'
`-mno-shared'
     When generating code using the Unix calling conventions (selected
     by `-KPIC' or `-mcall_shared'), gas will normally generate code
     which can go into a shared library.  The `-mno-shared' option
     tells gas to generate code which uses the calling convention, but
     can not go into a shared library.  The resulting code is slightly
     more efficient.  This option only affects the handling of the
     `.cpload' and `.cpsetup' pseudo-ops.

9.27.2 High-level assembly macros
---------------------------------

MIPS assemblers have traditionally provided a wider range of
instructions than the MIPS architecture itself.  These extra
instructions are usually referred to as "macro" instructions (1).

   Some MIPS macro instructions extend an underlying architectural
instruction while others are entirely new.  An example of the former
type is `and', which allows the third operand to be either a register
or an arbitrary immediate value.  Examples of the latter type include
`bgt', which branches to the third operand when the first operand is
greater than the second operand, and `ulh', which implements an
unaligned 2-byte load.

   One of the most common extensions provided by macros is to expand
memory offsets to the full address range (32 or 64 bits) and to allow
symbolic offsets such as `my_data + 4' to be used in place of integer
constants.  For example, the architectural instruction `lbu' allows
only a signed 16-bit offset, whereas the macro `lbu' allows code such
as `lbu $4,array+32769($5)'.  The implementation of these symbolic
offsets depends on several factors, such as whether the assembler is
generating SVR4-style PIC (selected by `-KPIC', *note Assembler
options: MIPS Options.), the size of symbols (*note Directives to
override the size of symbols: MIPS Symbol Sizes.), and the small data
limit (*note Controlling the use of small data accesses: MIPS Small
Data.).

   Sometimes it is undesirable to have one assembly instruction expand
to several machine instructions.  The directive `.set nomacro' tells
the assembler to warn when this happens.  `.set macro' restores the
default behavior.

   Some macro instructions need a temporary register to store
intermediate results.  This register is usually `$1', also known as
`$at', but it can be changed to any core register REG using `.set
at=REG'.  Note that `$at' always refers to `$1' regardless of which
register is being used as the temporary register.

   Implicit uses of the temporary register in macros could interfere
with explicit uses in the assembly code.  The assembler therefore warns
whenever it sees an explicit use of the temporary register.  The
directive `.set noat' silences this warning while `.set at' restores
the default behavior.  It is safe to use `.set noat' while `.set
nomacro' is in effect since single-instruction macros never need a
temporary register.

   Note that while the GNU assembler provides these macros for
compatibility, it does not make any attempt to optimize them with the
surrounding code.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The term "macro" is somewhat overloaded here, since these macros
have no relation to those defined by `.macro', *note `.macro': Macro.

9.27.3 Directives to override the size of symbols
-------------------------------------------------

The n64 ABI allows symbols to have any 64-bit value.  Although this
provides a great deal of flexibility, it means that some macros have
much longer expansions than their 32-bit counterparts.  For example,
the non-PIC expansion of `dla $4,sym' is usually:

     lui     $4,%highest(sym)
     lui     $1,%hi(sym)
     daddiu  $4,$4,%higher(sym)
     daddiu  $1,$1,%lo(sym)
     dsll32  $4,$4,0
     daddu   $4,$4,$1

   whereas the 32-bit expansion is simply:

     lui     $4,%hi(sym)
     daddiu  $4,$4,%lo(sym)

   n64 code is sometimes constructed in such a way that all symbolic
constants are known to have 32-bit values, and in such cases, it's
preferable to use the 32-bit expansion instead of the 64-bit expansion.

   You can use the `.set sym32' directive to tell the assembler that,
from this point on, all expressions of the form `SYMBOL' or `SYMBOL +
OFFSET' have 32-bit values.  For example:

     .set sym32
     dla     $4,sym
     lw      $4,sym+16
     sw      $4,sym+0x8000($4)

   will cause the assembler to treat `sym', `sym+16' and `sym+0x8000'
as 32-bit values.  The handling of non-symbolic addresses is not
affected.

   The directive `.set nosym32' ends a `.set sym32' block and reverts
to the normal behavior.  It is also possible to change the symbol size
using the command-line options `-msym32' and `-mno-sym32'.

   These options and directives are always accepted, but at present,
they have no effect for anything other than n64.

9.27.4 Controlling the use of small data accesses
-------------------------------------------------

It often takes several instructions to load the address of a symbol.
For example, when `addr' is a 32-bit symbol, the non-PIC expansion of
`dla $4,addr' is usually:

     lui     $4,%hi(addr)
     daddiu  $4,$4,%lo(addr)

   The sequence is much longer when `addr' is a 64-bit symbol.  *Note
Directives to override the size of symbols: MIPS Symbol Sizes.

   In order to cut down on this overhead, most embedded MIPS systems
set aside a 64-kilobyte "small data" area and guarantee that all data
of size N and smaller will be placed in that area.  The limit N is
passed to both the assembler and the linker using the command-line
option `-G N', *note Assembler options: MIPS Options.  Note that the
same value of N must be used when linking and when assembling all input
files to the link; any inconsistency could cause a relocation overflow
error.

   The size of an object in the `.bss' section is set by the `.comm' or
`.lcomm' directive that defines it.  The size of an external object may
be set with the `.extern' directive.  For example, `.extern sym,4'
declares that the object at `sym' is 4 bytes in length, while leaving
`sym' otherwise undefined.

   When no `-G' option is given, the default limit is 8 bytes.  The
option `-G 0' prevents any data from being automatically classified as
small.

   It is also possible to mark specific objects as small by putting them
in the special sections `.sdata' and `.sbss', which are "small"
counterparts of `.data' and `.bss' respectively.  The toolchain will
treat such data as small regardless of the `-G' setting.

   On startup, systems that support a small data area are expected to
initialize register `$28', also known as `$gp', in such a way that
small data can be accessed using a 16-bit offset from that register.
For example, when `addr' is small data, the `dla $4,addr' instruction
above is equivalent to:

     daddiu  $4,$28,%gp_rel(addr)

   Small data is not supported for SVR4-style PIC.

9.27.5 Directives to override the ISA level
-------------------------------------------

GNU `as' supports an additional directive to change the MIPS
Instruction Set Architecture level on the fly: `.set mipsN'.  N should
be a number from 0 to 5, or 32, 32r2, 32r3, 32r5, 32r6, 64, 64r2, 64r3,
64r5 or 64r6.  The values other than 0 make the assembler accept
instructions for the corresponding ISA level, from that point on in the
assembly.  `.set mipsN' affects not only which instructions are
permitted, but also how certain macros are expanded.  `.set mips0'
restores the ISA level to its original level: either the level you
selected with command line options, or the default for your
configuration.  You can use this feature to permit specific MIPS III
instructions while assembling in 32 bit mode.  Use this directive with
care!

   The `.set arch=CPU' directive provides even finer control.  It
changes the effective CPU target and allows the assembler to use
instructions specific to a particular CPU.  All CPUs supported by the
`-march' command line option are also selectable by this directive.
The original value is restored by `.set arch=default'.

   The directive `.set mips16' puts the assembler into MIPS 16 mode, in
which it will assemble instructions for the MIPS 16 processor.  Use
`.set nomips16' to return to normal 32 bit mode.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.

   The directive `.set micromips' puts the assembler into microMIPS
mode, in which it will assemble instructions for the microMIPS
processor.  Use `.set nomicromips' to return to normal 32 bit mode.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS assembly options,  Next: MIPS autoextend,  Prev: MIPS ISA,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

9.27.6 Directives to control code generation
--------------------------------------------

The `.module' directive allows command line options to be set directly
from assembly.  The format of the directive matches the `.set'
directive but only those options which are relevant to a whole module
are supported.  The effect of a `.module' directive is the same as the
corresponding command line option.  Where `.set' directives support
returning to a default then the `.module' directives do not as they
define the defaults.

   These module-level directives must appear first in assembly.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.

   The directive `.set insn32' makes the assembler only use 32-bit
instruction encodings when generating code for the microMIPS processor.
This directive inhibits the use of any 16-bit instructions from that
point on in the assembly.  The `.set noinsn32' directive allows 16-bit
instructions to be accepted.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS autoextend,  Next: MIPS insn,  Prev: MIPS assembly options,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

9.27.7 Directives for extending MIPS 16 bit instructions
--------------------------------------------------------

By default, MIPS 16 instructions are automatically extended to 32 bits
when necessary.  The directive `.set noautoextend' will turn this off.
When `.set noautoextend' is in effect, any 32 bit instruction must be
explicitly extended with the `.e' modifier (e.g., `li.e $4,1000').  The
directive `.set autoextend' may be used to once again automatically
extend instructions when necessary.

   This directive is only meaningful when in MIPS 16 mode.  Traditional
MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS insn,  Next: MIPS FP ABIs,  Prev: MIPS autoextend,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

9.27.8 Directive to mark data as an instruction
-----------------------------------------------

The `.insn' directive tells `as' that the following data is actually
instructions.  This makes a difference in MIPS 16 and microMIPS modes:
when loading the address of a label which precedes instructions, `as'
automatically adds 1 to the value, so that jumping to the loaded
address will do the right thing.

   The `.global' and `.globl' directives supported by `as' will by
default mark the symbol as pointing to a region of data not code.  This
means that, for example, any instructions following such a symbol will
not be disassembled by `objdump' as it will regard them as data.  To
change this behavior an optional section name can be placed after the
symbol name in the `.global' directive.  If this section exists and is
known to be a code section, then the symbol will be marked as pointing
at code not data.  Ie the syntax for the directive is:

   `.global SYMBOL[ SECTION][, SYMBOL[ SECTION]] ...',

   Here is a short example:

             .global foo .text, bar, baz .data
     foo:
             nop
     bar:
             .word 0x0
     baz:
             .word 0x1

9.27.9.1 History of FP ABIs
...........................

The MIPS ABIs support a variety of different floating-point extensions
where calling-convention and register sizes vary for floating-point
data.  The extensions exist to support a wide variety of optional
architecture features.  The resulting ABI variants are generally
incompatible with each other and must be tracked carefully.

   Traditionally the use of an explicit `.gnu_attribute 4, N' directive
is used to indicate which ABI is in use by a specific module.  It was
then left to the user to ensure that command line options and the
selected ABI were compatible with some potential for inconsistencies.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS FP ABI Variants,  Next: MIPS FP ABI Selection,  Prev: MIPS FP ABI History,  Up: MIPS FP ABIs

9.27.9.2 Supported FP ABIs
..........................

The supported floating-point ABI variants are:

`0 - No floating-point'
     This variant is used to indicate that floating-point is not used
     within the module at all and therefore has no impact on the ABI.
     This is the default.

`1 - Double-precision'
     This variant indicates that double-precision support is used.  For
     64-bit ABIs this means that 64-bit wide floating-point registers
     are required.  For 32-bit ABIs this means that 32-bit wide
     floating-point registers are required and double-precision
     operations use pairs of registers.

`2 - Single-precision'
     This variant indicates that single-precision support is used.
     Double precision operations will be supported via soft-float
     routines.

`3 - Soft-float'
     This variant indicates that although floating-point support is
     used all operations are emulated in software.  This means the ABI
     is modified to pass all floating-point data in general-purpose
     registers.

`4 - Deprecated'
     This variant existed as an initial attempt at supporting 64-bit
     wide floating-point registers for O32 ABI on a MIPS32r2 CPU.  This
     has been superseded by 5, 6 and 7.

`5 - Double-precision 32-bit CPU, 32-bit or 64-bit FPU'
     This variant is used by 32-bit ABIs to indicate that the
     floating-point code in the module has been designed to operate
     correctly with either 32-bit wide or 64-bit wide floating-point
     registers.  Double-precision support is used.  Only O32 currently
     supports this variant and requires a minimum architecture of MIPS
     II.

`6 - Double-precision 32-bit FPU, 64-bit FPU'
     This variant is used by 32-bit ABIs to indicate that the
     floating-point code in the module requires 64-bit wide
     floating-point registers.  Double-precision support is used.  Only
     O32 currently supports this variant and requires a minimum
     architecture of MIPS32r2.

`7 - Double-precision compat 32-bit FPU, 64-bit FPU'
     This variant is used by 32-bit ABIs to indicate that the
     floating-point code in the module requires 64-bit wide
     floating-point registers.  Double-precision support is used.  This
     differs from the previous ABI as it restricts use of odd-numbered
     single-precision registers.  Only O32 currently supports this
     variant and requires a minimum architecture of MIPS32r2.

9.27.9.3 Automatic selection of FP ABI
......................................

In order to simplify and add safety to the process of selecting the
correct floating-point ABI, the assembler will automatically infer the
correct `.gnu_attribute 4, N' directive based on command line options
and `.module' overrides.  Where an explicit `.gnu_attribute 4, N'
directive has been seen then a warning will be raised if it does not
match an inferred setting.

   The floating-point ABI is inferred as follows.  If `-msoft-float'
has been used the module will be marked as soft-float.  If
`-msingle-float' has been used then the module will be marked as
single-precision.  The remaining ABIs are then selected based on the FP
register width.  Double-precision is selected if the width of GP and FP
registers match and the special double-precision variants for 32-bit
ABIs are then selected depending on `-mfpxx', `-mfp64' and
`-mno-odd-spreg'.

9.27.9.4 Linking different FP ABI variants
..........................................

Modules using the default FP ABI (no floating-point) can be linked with
any other (singular) FP ABI variant.

   Special compatibility support exists for O32 with the four
double-precision FP ABI variants.  The `-mfpxx' FP ABI is specifically
designed to be compatible with the standard double-precision ABI and the
`-mfp64' FP ABIs.  This makes it desirable for O32 modules to be built
as `-mfpxx' to ensure the maximum compatibility with other modules
produced for more specific needs.  The only FP ABIs which cannot be
linked together are the standard double-precision ABI and the full
`-mfp64' ABI with `-modd-spreg'.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS NaN Encodings,  Next: MIPS Option Stack,  Prev: MIPS FP ABIs,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

9.27.10 Directives to record which NaN encoding is being used
-------------------------------------------------------------

The IEEE 754 floating-point standard defines two types of not-a-number
(NaN) data: "signalling" NaNs and "quiet" NaNs.  The original version
of the standard did not specify how these two types should be
distinguished.  Most implementations followed the i387 model, in which
the first bit of the significand is set for quiet NaNs and clear for
signalling NaNs.  However, the original MIPS implementation assigned the
opposite meaning to the bit, so that it was set for signalling NaNs and
clear for quiet NaNs.

   The 2008 revision of the standard formally suggested the i387 choice
and as from Sep 2012 the current release of the MIPS architecture
therefore optionally supports that form.  Code that uses one NaN
encoding would usually be incompatible with code that uses the other
NaN encoding, so MIPS ELF objects have a flag (`EF_MIPS_NAN2008') to
record which encoding is being used.

   Assembly files can use the `.nan' directive to select between the
two encodings.  `.nan 2008' says that the assembly file uses the IEEE
754-2008 encoding while `.nan legacy' says that the file uses the
original MIPS encoding.  If several `.nan' directives are given, the
final setting is the one that is used.

   The command-line options `-mnan=legacy' and `-mnan=2008' can be used
instead of `.nan legacy' and `.nan 2008' respectively.  However, any
`.nan' directive overrides the command-line setting.

   `.nan legacy' is the default if no `.nan' directive or `-mnan'
option is given.

   Note that GNU `as' does not produce NaNs itself and therefore these
directives do not affect code generation.  They simply control the
setting of the `EF_MIPS_NAN2008' flag.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support these directives.

9.27.11 Directives to save and restore options
----------------------------------------------

The directives `.set push' and `.set pop' may be used to save and
restore the current settings for all the options which are controlled
by `.set'.  The `.set push' directive saves the current settings on a
stack.  The `.set pop' directive pops the stack and restores the
settings.

   These directives can be useful inside an macro which must change an
option such as the ISA level or instruction reordering but does not want
to change the state of the code which invoked the macro.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support these directives.

The directive `.set mips3d' makes the assembler accept instructions
from the MIPS-3D Application Specific Extension from that point on in
the assembly.  The `.set nomips3d' directive prevents MIPS-3D
instructions from being accepted.

   The directive `.set smartmips' makes the assembler accept
instructions from the SmartMIPS Application Specific Extension to the
MIPS32 ISA from that point on in the assembly.  The `.set nosmartmips'
directive prevents SmartMIPS instructions from being accepted.

   The directive `.set mdmx' makes the assembler accept instructions

assembly.  The `.set nomdmx' directive prevents MDMX instructions from
being accepted.

   The directive `.set dsp' makes the assembler accept instructions
from the DSP Release 1 Application Specific Extension from that point
on in the assembly.  The `.set nodsp' directive prevents DSP Release 1
instructions from being accepted.

   The directive `.set dspr2' makes the assembler accept instructions
from the DSP Release 2 Application Specific Extension from that point
on in the assembly.  This directive implies `.set dsp'.  The `.set
nodspr2' directive prevents DSP Release 2 instructions from being
accepted.

   The directive `.set dspr3' makes the assembler accept instructions
from the DSP Release 3 Application Specific Extension from that point
on in the assembly.  This directive implies `.set dsp' and `.set
dspr2'.  The `.set nodspr3' directive prevents DSP Release 3
instructions from being accepted.

the MT Application Specific Extension from that point on in the
assembly.  The `.set nomt' directive prevents MT instructions from
being accepted.

   The directive `.set mcu' makes the assembler accept instructions
from the MCU Application Specific Extension from that point on in the

   The directive `.set msa' makes the assembler accept instructions
from the MIPS SIMD Architecture Extension from that point on in the

File: as.info,  Node: MMIX-Opts,  Next: MMIX-Expand,  Up: MMIX-Dependent

9.28.1 Command-line Options
---------------------------

The MMIX version of `as' has some machine-dependent options.

   When `--fixed-special-register-names' is specified, only the register
names specified in *Note MMIX-Regs:: are recognized in the instructions
`PUT' and `GET'.

   You can use the `--globalize-symbols' to make all symbols global.
This option is useful when splitting up a `mmixal' program into several
files.

   The `--gnu-syntax' turns off most syntax compatibility with
`mmixal'.  Its usability is currently doubtful.

   The `--relax' option is not fully supported, but will eventually make
the object file prepared for linker relaxation.

   If you want to avoid inadvertently calling a predefined symbol and
would rather get an error, for example when using `as' with a compiler
or other machine-generated code, specify `--no-predefined-syms'.  This
turns off built-in predefined definitions of all such symbols,
including rounding-mode symbols, segment symbols, `BIT' symbols, and
`TRAP' symbols used in `mmix' "system calls".  It also turns off
predefined special-register names, except when used in `PUT' and `GET'
instructions.

   By default, some instructions are expanded to fit the size of the
operand or an external symbol (*note MMIX-Expand::).  By passing
`--no-expand', no such expansion will be done, instead causing errors
at link time if the operand does not fit.

   The `mmixal' documentation (*note mmixsite::) specifies that global
registers allocated with the `GREG' directive (*note MMIX-greg::) and
initialized to the same non-zero value, will refer to the same global
register.  This isn't strictly enforceable in `as' since the final
addresses aren't known until link-time, but it will do an effort unless
the `--no-merge-gregs' option is specified.  (Register merging isn't
yet implemented in `ld'.)

   `as' will warn every time it expands an instruction to fit an
operand unless the option `-x' is specified.  It is believed that this
behaviour is more useful than just mimicking `mmixal''s behaviour, in
which instructions are only expanded if the `-x' option is specified,
and assembly fails otherwise, when an instruction needs to be expanded.
It needs to be kept in mind that `mmixal' is both an assembler and
linker, while `as' will expand instructions that at link stage can be
contracted.  (Though linker relaxation isn't yet implemented in `ld'.)
The option `-x' also implies `--linker-allocated-gregs'.

   If instruction expansion is enabled, `as' can expand a `PUSHJ'
instruction into a series of instructions.  The shortest expansion is
to not expand it, but just mark the call as redirectable to a stub,
which `ld' creates at link-time, but only if the original `PUSHJ'
instruction is found not to reach the target.  The stub consists of the
necessary instructions to form a jump to the target.  This happens if
`as' can assert that the `PUSHJ' instruction can reach such a stub.
The option `--no-pushj-stubs' disables this shorter expansion, and the
longer series of instructions is then created at assembly-time.  The
option `--no-stubs' is a synonym, intended for compatibility with
future releases, where generation of stubs for other instructions may
be implemented.

   Usually a two-operand-expression (*note GREG-base::) without a
matching `GREG' directive is treated as an error by `as'.  When the
option `--linker-allocated-gregs' is in effect, they are instead passed
through to the linker, which will allocate as many global registers as
is needed.

9.28.2 Instruction expansion
----------------------------

When `as' encounters an instruction with an operand that is either not
known or does not fit the operand size of the instruction, `as' (and
`ld') will expand the instruction into a sequence of instructions
semantically equivalent to the operand fitting the instruction.
Expansion will take place for the following instructions:

`GETA'
     Expands to a sequence of four instructions: `SETL', `INCML',
     `INCMH' and `INCH'.  The operand must be a multiple of four.

Conditional branches
     A branch instruction is turned into a branch with the complemented
     condition and prediction bit over five instructions; four
     instructions setting `$255' to the operand value, which like with
     `GETA' must be a multiple of four, and a final `GO $255,$255,0'.

`PUSHJ'
     Similar to expansion for conditional branches; four instructions
     set `$255' to the operand value, followed by a `PUSHGO
     $255,$255,0'.

`JMP'
     Similar to conditional branches and `PUSHJ'.  The final instruction
     is `GO $255,$255,0'.

   The linker `ld' is expected to shrink these expansions for code
assembled with `--relax' (though not currently implemented).

9.28.3 Syntax
-------------

The assembly syntax is supposed to be upward compatible with that
described in Sections 1.3 and 1.4 of `The Art of Computer Programming,
Volume 1'.  Draft versions of those chapters as well as other MMIX
information is located at
`http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix-news.html'.  Most code
examples from the mmixal package located there should work unmodified
when assembled and linked as single files, with a few noteworthy
exceptions (*note MMIX-mmixal::).

   Before an instruction is emitted, the current location is aligned to
the next four-byte boundary.  If a label is defined at the beginning of
the line, its value will be the aligned value.

   In addition to the traditional hex-prefix `0x', a hexadecimal number
can also be specified by the prefix character `#'.

   After all operands to an MMIX instruction or directive have been
specified, the rest of the line is ignored, treated as a comment.

9.28.3.1 Special Characters
...........................

The characters `*' and `#' are line comment characters; each start a
comment at the beginning of a line, but only at the beginning of a
line.  A `#' prefixes a hexadecimal number if found elsewhere on a
line.  If a `#' appears at the start of a line the whole line is
treated as a comment, but the line can also act as a logical line
number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control command
(*note Preprocessing::).

   Two other characters, `%' and `!', each start a comment anywhere on
the line.  Thus you can't use the `modulus' and `not' operators in
expressions normally associated with these two characters.

   A `;' is a line separator, treated as a new-line, so separate
instructions can be specified on a single line.


File: as.info,  Node: MMIX-Symbols,  Next: MMIX-Regs,  Prev: MMIX-Chars,  Up: MMIX-Syntax

9.28.3.2 Symbols
................

The character `:' is permitted in identifiers.  There are two
exceptions to it being treated as any other symbol character: if a
symbol begins with `:', it means that the symbol is in the global
namespace and that the current prefix should not be prepended to that
symbol (*note MMIX-prefix::).  The `:' is then not considered part of
the symbol.  For a symbol in the label position (first on a line), a `:'
at the end of a symbol is silently stripped off.  A label is permitted,
but not required, to be followed by a `:', as with many other assembly
formats.

   The character `@' in an expression, is a synonym for `.', the
current location.

   In addition to the common forward and backward local symbol formats
(*note Symbol Names::), they can be specified with upper-case `B' and
`F', as in `8B' and `9F'.  A local label defined for the current
position is written with a `H' appended to the number:
     3H LDB $0,$1,2
   This and traditional local-label formats cannot be mixed: a label
must be defined and referred to using the same format.

   There's a minor caveat: just as for the ordinary local symbols, the
local symbols are translated into ordinary symbols using control
characters are to hide the ordinal number of the symbol.
Unfortunately, these symbols are not translated back in error messages.
Thus you may see confusing error messages when local symbols are used.
Control characters `\003' (control-C) and `\004' (control-D) are used
for the MMIX-specific local-symbol syntax.

   The symbol `Main' is handled specially; it is always global.

   By defining the symbols `__.MMIX.start..text' and
`__.MMIX.start..data', the address of respectively the `.text' and
`.data' segments of the final program can be defined, though when
linking more than one object file, the code or data in the object file
containing the symbol is not guaranteed to be start at that position;
just the final executable.  *Note MMIX-loc::.

9.28.3.3 Register names
.......................

Local and global registers are specified as `$0' to `$255'.  The
recognized special register names are `rJ', `rA', `rB', `rC', `rD',
`rE', `rF', `rG', `rH', `rI', `rK', `rL', `rM', `rN', `rO', `rP', `rQ',
`rR', `rS', `rT', `rU', `rV', `rW', `rX', `rY', `rZ', `rBB', `rTT',
`rWW', `rXX', `rYY' and `rZZ'.  A leading `:' is optional for special
register names.

   Local and global symbols can be equated to register names and used in
place of ordinary registers.

   Similarly for special registers, local and global symbols can be
used.  Also, symbols equated from numbers and constant expressions are
allowed in place of a special register, except when either of the
options `--no-predefined-syms' and `--fixed-special-register-names' are
specified.  Then only the special register names above are allowed for
the instructions having a special register operand; `GET' and `PUT'.

9.28.3.4 Assembler Directives
.............................

`LOC'
     The `LOC' directive sets the current location to the value of the
     operand field, which may include changing sections.  If the
     operand is a constant, the section is set to either `.data' if the
     value is `0x2000000000000000' or larger, else it is set to `.text'.
     Within a section, the current location may only be changed to
     monotonically higher addresses.  A LOC expression must be a
     previously defined symbol or a "pure" constant.

     An example, which sets the label PREV to the current location, and
     updates the current location to eight bytes forward:
          prev LOC @+8

     When a LOC has a constant as its operand, a symbol
     `__.MMIX.start..text' or `__.MMIX.start..data' is defined
     depending on the address as mentioned above.  Each such symbol is
     interpreted as special by the linker, locating the section at that
     address.  Note that if multiple files are linked, the first object
     file with that section will be mapped to that address (not
     necessarily the file with the LOC definition).

`LOCAL'
     Example:
           LOCAL external_symbol
           LOCAL 42
           .local asymbol

     This directive-operation generates a link-time assertion that the
     operand does not correspond to a global register.  The operand is
     an expression that at link-time resolves to a register symbol or a
     number.  A number is treated as the register having that number.
     There is one restriction on the use of this directive: the
     pseudo-directive must be placed in a section with contents, code
     or data.

`IS'
     The `IS' directive:
          asymbol IS an_expression
     sets the symbol `asymbol' to `an_expression'.  A symbol may not be
     set more than once using this directive.  Local labels may be set
     using this directive, for example:
          5H IS @+4

`GREG'
     This directive reserves a global register, gives it an initial
     value and optionally gives it a symbolic name.  Some examples:

          areg GREG
          breg GREG data_value
               GREG data_buffer
               .greg creg, another_data_value

     The symbolic register name can be used in place of a (non-special)
     register.  If a value isn't provided, it defaults to zero.  Unless
     the option `--no-merge-gregs' is specified, non-zero registers
     allocated with this directive may be eliminated by `as'; another
     register with the same value used in its place.  Any of the
     instructions `CSWAP', `GO', `LDA', `LDBU', `LDB', `LDHT', `LDOU',
     `LDO', `LDSF', `LDTU', `LDT', `LDUNC', `LDVTS', `LDWU', `LDW',
     `PREGO', `PRELD', `PREST', `PUSHGO', `STBU', `STB', `STCO', `STHT',
     `STOU', `STSF', `STTU', `STT', `STUNC', `SYNCD', `SYNCID', can
     have a value nearby an initial value in place of its second and
     third operands.  Here, "nearby" is defined as within the range
     0...255 from the initial value of such an allocated register.

          buffer1 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
          buffer2 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
           ...
           GREG buffer1
           LDOU $42,buffer2
     In the example above, the `Y' field of the `LDOUI' instruction
     (LDOU with a constant Z) will be replaced with the global register
     allocated for `buffer1', and the `Z' field will have the value 5,
     the offset from `buffer1' to `buffer2'.  The result is equivalent
     to this code:
          buffer1 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
          buffer2 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
           ...
          tmpreg GREG buffer1
           LDOU $42,tmpreg,(buffer2-buffer1)

     Global registers allocated with this directive are allocated in
     order higher-to-lower within a file.  Other than that, the exact
     order of register allocation and elimination is undefined.  For
     example, the order is undefined when more than one file with such
     directives are linked together.  With the options `-x' and
     `--linker-allocated-gregs', `GREG' directives for two-operand
     cases like the one mentioned above can be omitted.  Sufficient
     global registers will then be allocated by the linker.

`BYTE'
     The `BYTE' directive takes a series of operands separated by a
     comma.  If an operand is a string (*note Strings::), each
     character of that string is emitted as a byte.  Other operands
     must be constant expressions without forward references, in the
     range 0...255.  If you need operands having expressions with
     forward references, use `.byte' (*note Byte::).  An operand can be
     omitted, defaulting to a zero value.

`WYDE'
`TETRA'
`OCTA'
     The directives `WYDE', `TETRA' and `OCTA' emit constants of two,
     four and eight bytes size respectively.  Before anything else
     happens for the directive, the current location is aligned to the
     respective constant-size boundary.  If a label is defined at the
     beginning of the line, its value will be that after the alignment.
     A single operand can be omitted, defaulting to a zero value
     emitted for the directive.  Operands can be expressed as strings
     (*note Strings::), in which case each character in the string is
     emitted as a separate constant of the size indicated by the
     directive.

`PREFIX'
     The `PREFIX' directive sets a symbol name prefix to be prepended to
     all symbols (except local symbols, *note MMIX-Symbols::), that are
     not prefixed with `:', until the next `PREFIX' directive.  Such
     prefixes accumulate.  For example,
           PREFIX a
           PREFIX b
          c IS 0
     defines a symbol `abc' with the value 0.

`BSPEC'
`ESPEC'
     A pair of `BSPEC' and `ESPEC' directives delimit a section of
     special contents (without specified semantics).  Example:
           BSPEC 42
           TETRA 1,2,3
           ESPEC
     The single operand to `BSPEC' must be number in the range 0...255.
     The `BSPEC' number 80 is used by the GNU binutils implementation.

9.28.4 Differences to `mmixal'
------------------------------

The binutils `as' and `ld' combination has a few differences in
function compared to `mmixal' (*note mmixsite::).

   The replacement of a symbol with a GREG-allocated register (*note
GREG-base::) is not handled the exactly same way in `as' as in
`mmixal'.  This is apparent in the `mmixal' example file `inout.mms',
where different registers with different offsets, eventually yielding
the same address, are used in the first instruction.  This type of
difference should however not affect the function of any program unless
it has specific assumptions about the allocated register number.

   Line numbers (in the `mmo' object format) are currently not
supported.

   Expression operator precedence is not that of mmixal: operator
precedence is that of the C programming language.  It's recommended to
use parentheses to explicitly specify wanted operator precedence
whenever more than one type of operators are used.

   The serialize unary operator `&', the fractional division operator
`//', the logical not operator `!' and the modulus operator `%' are not
available.

   Symbols are not global by default, unless the option
`--globalize-symbols' is passed.  Use the `.global' directive to
globalize symbols (*note Global::).

   Operand syntax is a bit stricter with `as' than `mmixal'.  For
example, you can't say `addu 1,2,3', instead you must write `addu
$1,$2,3'.

   You can't LOC to a lower address than those already visited (i.e.,
"backwards").

   A LOC directive must come before any emitted code.

   Predefined symbols are visible as file-local symbols after use.  (In
the ELF file, that is--the linked mmo file has no notion of a file-local
symbol.)

   Some mapping of constant expressions to sections in LOC expressions
is attempted, but that functionality is easily confused and should be
avoided unless compatibility with `mmixal' is required.  A LOC
expression to `0x2000000000000000' or higher, maps to the `.data'
section and lower addresses map to the `.text' section (*note
MMIX-loc::).

   The code and data areas are each contiguous.  Sparse programs with
far-away LOC directives will take up the same amount of space as a
contiguous program with zeros filled in the gaps between the LOC
directives.  If you need sparse programs, you might try and get the
wanted effect with a linker script and splitting up the code parts into
sections (*note Section::).  Assembly code for this, to be compatible
with `mmixal', would look something like:
      .if 0
      LOC away_expression
      .else
      .section away,"ax"
      .fi
   `as' will not execute the LOC directive and `mmixal' ignores the
lines with `.'.  This construct can be used generally to help
compatibility.

   Symbols can't be defined twice-not even to the same value.

   Instruction mnemonics are recognized case-insensitive, though the
`IS' and `GREG' pseudo-operations must be specified in upper-case
characters.

   There's no unicode support.

   The following is a list of programs in `mmix.tar.gz', available at
`http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix-news.html', last
checked with the version dated 2001-08-25 (md5sum

not assemble with `as':

`silly.mms'
     LOC to a previous address.

`sim.mms'
     Redefines symbol `Done'.

`test.mms'
     Uses the serial operator `&'.

     specified.

`-mcpu'
     selects the cpu architecture.  If the architecture is 430Xv2 then
     this also enables NOP generation unless the `-mN' is also
     specified.

`-msilicon-errata=NAME[,NAME...]'
     Implements a fixup for named silicon errata.  Multiple silicon
     errata can be specified by multiple uses of the `-msilicon-errata'
     option and/or by including the errata names, separated by commas,
     on an individual `-msilicon-errata' option.  Errata names
     currently recognised by the assembler are:

    `cpu4'
          `PUSH #4' and `PUSH #8' need longer encodings on the MSP430.
          This option is enabled by default, and cannot be disabled.

    `cpu8'
          Do not set the `SP' to an odd value.

    `cpu11'
          Do not update the `SR' and the `PC' in the same instruction.

    `cpu12'
          Do not use the `PC' in a `CMP' or `BIT' instruction.

    `cpu13'
          Do not use an arithmetic instruction to modify the `SR'.

    `cpu19'
          Insert `NOP' after `CPUOFF'.

`-msilicon-errata-warn=NAME[,NAME...]'
     Like the `-msilicon-errata' option except that instead of fixing
     the specified errata, a warning message is issued instead.  This
     option can be used alongside `-msilicon-errata' to generate
     messages whenever a problem is fixed, or on its own in order to
     inspect code for potential problems.

`-mP'
     enables polymorph instructions handler.

`-mQ'
     enables relaxation at assembly time. DANGEROUS!

`-ml'
     indicates that the input uses the large code model.

`-mn'
     enables the generation of a NOP instruction following any
     instruction that might change the interrupts enabled/disabled
     state.  The pipelined nature of the MSP430 core means that any
     instruction that changes the interrupt state (`EINT', `DINT', `BIC
     #8, SR', `BIS #8, SR' or `MOV.W <>, SR') must be followed by a NOP
     instruction in order to ensure the correct processing of
     interrupts.  By default it is up to the programmer to supply these
     NOP instructions, but this command line option enables the
     automatic insertion by the assembler, if they are missing.

`-mN'
     disables the generation of a NOP instruction following any
     instruction that might change the interrupts enabled/disabled
     state.  This is the default behaviour.

`-my'
     tells the assembler to generate a warning message if a NOP does not
     immediately follow an instruction that enables or disables
     interrupts.  This is the default.

     Note that this option can be stacked with the `-mn' option so that
     the assembler will both warn about missing NOP instructions and
     then insert them automatically.

`-mY'
     disables warnings about missing NOP instructions.

`-md'
     mark the object file as one that requires data to copied from ROM
     to RAM at execution startup.  Disabled by default.

9.29.2.1 Macros
...............

The macro syntax used on the MSP 430 is like that described in the MSP
430 Family Assembler Specification.  Normal `as' macros should still
work.

   Additional built-in macros are:

`llo(exp)'
     Extracts least significant word from 32-bit expression 'exp'.

`lhi(exp)'
     Extracts most significant word from 32-bit expression 'exp'.

`hlo(exp)'
     Extracts 3rd word from 64-bit expression 'exp'.

`hhi(exp)'
     Extracts 4rd word from 64-bit expression 'exp'.


   They normally being used as an immediate source operand.
         mov	#llo(1), r10	;	== mov	#1, r10
         mov	#lhi(1), r10	;	== mov	#0, r10

9.29.2.2 Special Characters
...........................

A semicolon (`;') appearing anywhere on a line starts a comment that
extends to the end of that line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but it can also be a logical line number
directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control command (*note
Preprocessing::).

   Multiple statements can appear on the same line provided that they
are separated by the `{' character.

   The character `$' in jump instructions indicates current location and
implemented only for TI syntax compatibility.

9.29.2.3 Register Names
.......................

General-purpose registers are represented by predefined symbols of the
form `rN' (for global registers), where N represents a number between
`0' and `15'.  The leading letters may be in either upper or lower
case; for example, `r13' and `R7' are both valid register names.

   Register names `PC', `SP' and `SR' cannot be used as register names
and will be treated as variables. Use `r0', `r1', and `r2' instead.


File: as.info,  Node: MSP430-Ext,  Prev: MSP430-Regs,  Up: MSP430 Syntax

9.29.2.4 Assembler Extensions
.............................

`@rN'
     As destination operand being treated as `0(rn)'

`0(rN)'
     As source operand being treated as `@rn'

`jCOND +N'
     Skips next N bytes followed by jump instruction and equivalent to
     `jCOND $+N+2'


   Also, there are some instructions, which cannot be found in other
assemblers.  These are branch instructions, which has different opcodes
upon jump distance.  They all got PC relative addressing mode.

`beq label'
     A polymorph instruction which is `jeq label' in case if jump
     distance within allowed range for cpu's jump instruction. If not,
     this unrolls into a sequence of
            jne $+6
            br  label

`bne label'
     A polymorph instruction which is `jne label' or `jeq +4; br label'

`blt label'
     A polymorph instruction which is `jl label' or `jge +4; br label'

`bltn label'
     A polymorph instruction which is `jn label' or `jn +2; jmp +4; br
     label'

`bltu label'
     A polymorph instruction which is `jlo label' or `jhs +2; br label'

`bge label'
     A polymorph instruction which is `jge label' or `jl +4; br label'

`bgeu label'
     A polymorph instruction which is `jhs label' or `jlo +4; br label'

     jlo +4; br label'

`bleu label'
     A polymorph instruction which is `jeq label; jlo label' or `jeq
     +2; jhs +4; br label'

`ble label'
     A polymorph instruction which is `jeq label; jl  label' or `jeq
     +2; jge +4; br label'

`jump label'

9.29.4 MSP 430 Machine Directives
---------------------------------

`.file'
     This directive is ignored; it is accepted for compatibility with
     other MSP 430 assemblers.

          _Warning:_ in other versions of the GNU assembler, `.file' is
          used for the directive called `.app-file' in the MSP 430
          support.

`.line'
     This directive is ignored; it is accepted for compatibility with
     other MSP 430 assemblers.

`.arch'
     Sets the target microcontroller in the same way as the `-mmcu'
     command line option.

`.cpu'
     Sets the target architecture in the same way as the `-mcpu'
     command line option.

`.profiler'
     This directive instructs assembler to add new profile entry to the
     object file.

`.refsym'
     This directive instructs assembler to add an undefined reference to
     the symbol following the directive.  The maximum symbol name
     length is 1023 characters.  No relocation is created for this
     symbol; it will exist purely for pulling in object files from
     archives.  Note that this reloc is not sufficient to prevent
     garbage collection; use a KEEP() directive in the linker file to
     preserve such objects.

`as' implements all the standard MSP 430 opcodes.  No additional
pseudo-instructions are needed on this family.

File: as.info,  Node: MSP430 Profiling Capability,  Prev: MSP430 Opcodes,  Up: MSP430-Dependent

9.29.6 Profiling Capability
---------------------------

It is a performance hit to use gcc's profiling approach for this tiny
target.  Even more - jtag hardware facility does not perform any
profiling functions.  However we've got gdb's built-in simulator where
we can do anything.

   We define new section `.profiler' which holds all profiling
information.  We define new pseudo operation `.profiler' which will
instruct assembler to add new profile entry to the object file. Profile
should take place at the present address.

   Pseudo operation format:

   `.profiler flags,function_to_profile [, cycle_corrector, extra]'

   where:

          `flags' is a combination of the following characters:

    `s'
          function entry

    `x'
          function exit

    `i'
          function is in init section

    `f'
          function is in fini section

    `l'
          library call

    `c'
          libc standard call

    `d'
          stack value demand

    `I'
          interrupt service routine

    `P'
          prologue start

    `p'
          prologue end

    `E'
          epilogue start

    `e'
          epilogue end

    `j'
          long jump / sjlj unwind

    `a'
          an arbitrary code fragment

    `t'
          extra parameter saved (a constant value like frame size)

`function_to_profile'
     a function address

`cycle_corrector'
     a value which should be added to the cycle counter, zero if
     omitted.

`extra'
     any extra parameter, zero if omitted.


   For example:
     .global fxx
     .type fxx,@function
     fxx:
     .LFrameOffset_fxx=0x08
     .profiler "scdP", fxx     ; function entry.
     			  ; we also demand stack value to be saved
       push r11
       push r10
       push r9
       push r8
     .profiler "cdpt",fxx,0, .LFrameOffset_fxx  ; check stack value at this point
     					  ; (this is a prologue end)
     					  ; note, that spare var filled with
     					  ; the farme size
       mov r15,r8
     ...
     .profiler cdE,fxx         ; check stack
       pop r8
       pop r9
       pop r10
       pop r11
     .profiler xcde,fxx,3      ; exit adds 3 to the cycle counter
       ret                     ; cause 'ret' insn takes 3 cycles
